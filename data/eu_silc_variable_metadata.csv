Variable Name,Short Description,Long Description (Summarized)
DB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"The year in which the survey-data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
DB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,"The country of residence is the country in which the usual residence of the person/household is located. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The SCL GEO is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CL_GE O&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC. Country code, year and IDs are used as key variables to merge different files."
DB030,HOUSEHOLD ID,"Household ID (maximum nine digits) = Household number (maximum seven digits) + split number (two digits) Every household will receive a household number. This number is the base upon which to construct the household ID and the personal ID. It should be a sequential number and should not contain other information. It must NOT contain any information that conflicts with confidentiality rules. This number must be unique for all the years of the survey. The household identification number (ID) is composed of the household number and the split number. The household number is a unique number assigned to each household in wave 1. The split number for the first wave must always take the value ‘00’. When a household stays in the sample, it keeps the household number and split number from one wave to the next. In the case of a split-off, the initial household will keep the household number and split number from one wave to the next. The other households, i.e., the split-off households, will keep the same household number, but will be assigned the next available unique split number in sequence. In cases when there is more than one split-off, the split number is formed by adding 1 to the highest used split number (for all the years of the survey). When there is a fusion of two sample households and the new household is located at an address where one of the households was previously interviewed the new household should keep the household number and split number of the household at that address in the previous wave. When the new household is located at a new address, the household number and split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ should be used."
DB040,REGION OF RESIDENCE,"The region of residence is the region within the country of residence in which the usual residence of the household is located at the date of interview. From 2021 onwards Under Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council all Member States’ statistics that are submitted to the Commission (Eurostat) and that are to be broken down by territorial units should use the NUTS classification. Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, data on the territorial units should be provided in accordance with the NUTS classification. NUTS (2-digits) For Member States of the EU, regions are defined on the basis of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) as described in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (as amended)22 and Annex I. For EFTA and Candidate countries, region refers to the classification of Statistical Regions23. Information about the NUTS is available here: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview. 22 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32003R1059 23 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/statistical-regions-outside-eu"
DB050,STRATUM,"DB050 reports on the primary stratum corresponding to each observation unit (individual or household) in case the target population (or a part thereof) is stratified at the first stage of the sample design, providing identification codes for the different strata. The information on the variable should be filled in for all waves, and it should always refer to the situation at the time the concerned unit (individual or household) is selected; it consequently does not refer to the strata used for post-stratification. DB050 collects information about primary strata, the strata used in selecting the sample. The variable label is changed from ‘Primary strata’ [Primary strata as used in the selection of the sample]’ used before, to ‘Stratum’ used from 2021 onwards, harmonised with social standardised variables. Stratifying a population means dividing it into non-overlapping subpopulations called strata. Independent samples are then selected within each stratum. The variable contains sampling information that is needed to calculate measures of spread (e.g., variance and standard deviation) and to observe changes over time. The category 'stratum identifier' provides the identification code of the stratum each observation unit (individual or household) belongs to. Stratum identification codes are to be used in case the target population has been stratified, or in case self-representing primary sampling units (PSUs) have been considered24. The category 'not applicable' is to be used in case the target population has not been stratified at the first stage of the sampling process (e.g., when the sample has been drawn by simple random sampling or by cluster random sampling), and self-representing PSUs have not been considered. Information on the variable should be filled in for all waves (and/or panels), and it should always refer to the situation at the time the concerned unit (individual or household) is selected. In case the target population is stratified at the first stage of the sampling design (or in case of comparable sample design), all primary strata receive a unique identification code which remains the same for the entire period in which the observation units (individual or household) that receive this identification code remain in 24 Self-representing PSUs are PSUs selected with a probability of 1, which must be considered to be a stratum rather than a PSU."
DB060,PRIMARY SAMPLING UNITS [PSU],"DB060 measures PSUs as used in selecting the sample and it is part of a standardised list of variables. If direct-element sampling is either impossible (lack of a sampling frame) or too expensive to implement (the population is widely distributed geographically), multi-stage selections can be done. Firstly, the population is divided into disjoint sub-populations, called primary sampling units (PSUs). A sample of PSUs is then selected (first–stage sampling). Secondly, each sampled PSU is itself divided into disjoint sub-populations, called secondary sampling units (SSUs). SSUs are then independently drawn from each PSU (second- stage sampling) and so on. The variable reports on the PSU corresponding to each observation unit (individual or household) in case the target population is divided into clusters, providing identification codes for the clusters or PSUs. The information recorded always refers to the situation at the time the concerned unit is selected (individual or household). A population is divided into clusters (i.e., disjoint sub-populations) in case direct-element sampling is either impossible (due to lack of a sampling frame) or too expensive to implement (the population is widely distributed geographically). A sample of clusters (PSUs) is then selected at the first stage of the sampling process (or an alternative multi-stage selection process). The variable contains sampling information that is needed to calculate measures of spread (e.g. variance or standard deviation) and to observe changes over time. The category 'primary sampling unit identifier' provides the identification code of the selected PSU each observation unit (individual or household) belongs to, in case the target population has been divided into clusters in the first stage of sampling. The category 'not applicable' is to be used when the target population has not been clustered at the first stage of the sampling process, e.g., when the sample has been drawn by simple random sampling or by stratified random sampling. Information on the variable should be filled for all waves (and/or panels), and it should always refer to the situation at the time the concerned unit (individual or household) is selected. In case the target population is clustered at the first stage of the sampling design, the selected clusters (PSUs) receive a unique identification code which remains the same for the entire period in which the observation"
DB062,SECONDARY SAMPLING UNITS [SSU],"If direct-element sampling is either impossible (lack of sampling frame) or too expensive to implement (the population is widely distributed geographically), multi-stage selections can be done. Firstly, the population is divided into disjoint sub-populations, called primary sampling units (PSUs). A sample of PSUs is then selected (first–stage sampling). Secondly, each sampled PSU is divided itself into disjoint sub-populations, called secondary sampling units (SSUs). SSUs are then independently drawn from each PSU (second- stage sampling) and so on, see DB060. DB062 provides identification codes for the selected PSUs (SSUs) as used in selecting the sample, secondary sampling units. In the case that the same SSU is selected several times (‘multiple hits’), the SSU receives a unique value for every hit. If the first stage of the sample design consists of a selection of households, households receive a unique code for variable DB060 that remains the same throughout EU-SILC’s entire duration. In the latter case split- off households keep their original value at the moment they are selected for variable DB060. In case there is at least a third stage of selection, additional variables DB06i must be transmitted as identification numbers for the units sampled at stage ‘i'. In the case of self-representing PSUs (for a definition see variable DB050), SSUs should be treated as if they were PSUs and receive a unique code for variable DB060. If households are selected at the second stage, they receive a unique value for variable DB060 that remains the same throughout EU-SILC’s entire duration. In the latter case split-off households keep their original value at the moment of selection for variable DB060. The identification of the self-representing units themselves is implemented in variable DB050."
DB070,ORDER OF SELECTION OF PSU,"If primary sampling units (or households in case of direct-element sampling) are selected systematically, DB070 contains the rank of selection of those units, order of selection of PSU, and order of selection of PSU as used in the selection of the sample. If PSUs rotate in and out of the sample, this rank should correspond to the rank on the sampling frame, such that PSUs newly selected in the sample could be grouped together on the basis of the order of all PSUs on the sampling frame. The value for DB070 of every selected PSU remains the same for the entire duration of EU-SILC. This information is important for variance estimation purposes because a systematic drawing from a judiciously ordered sampling frame may substantially reduce sampling errors. If systematic selections have been performed at other sampling stages, additional variables DB070 (i-1), that is the order of the selection of the units of stage ‘i' (i>1), must be transmitted too. In order to facilitate the computation of the standard errors for i) the common EU indicators, ii) the equivalised disposable income, iii)  the unadjusted gender pay gap and iv)  a list of income components, countries should28 fill in this (these) variable(s) (in the case of systematic selection) for all panels and waves in the file, and not 28 Agreement during the Living Conditions Working Group meeting in June 2009"
DB075,ROTATION GROUP,"This variable must be filled only for the countries using a rotational design. Rotational design Refers to any sample selection which is based on a fixed number of sub-samples, called replications, each one representative of the target population at the time of their selection. Each year, one sub-sample rotates out and a new one is drawn as a substitute. In the case of a rotational design based on four replications with a rotation of one replication per year, one of the replications must be dropped immediately after the first year, the second must be retained for 2 years, the third for 3 years, and the fourth for 4 years. From the second year onwards, at the start of each new year one replication must be introduced and retained for 4 years. Rotation group Each replication is called a rotational group and the information on the group to which the household belongs is especially useful for controlling the implementation of the sample over time. Regarding the numbering of the rotation groups over time, it is recommended that each rotation group keeps the same number throughout the period of the survey (see figure hereafter): PATTERN FOR ENUMERATION OF ROTATIONAL GROUPS new rotational group old rotational group Year of survey t 1 2 3 4 t+1 2 3 4 1 t+2 3 4 1 2 t+3 4 1 2 3 t+4 1 2 3 4 t+5 t+6 In case of 6 years rotation used"
DB076,INTERVIEW WAVE,"The wave corresponds to the number of years the respective household stays in the survey. If the household is in the data sample for the first time, the value 1 should be selected. If the household is in the sample for the second time, the value 2 should be selected, value 3 for the third time, value 4 for the fourth time, etc. The same approach should be used when using a longer panel. A split-off household keeps the same wave as the initial household."
DB080,HOUSEHOLD DESIGN WEIGHT,"Weighting for the first year of each sub-sample Design weights (household weights DB080 and ‘Selected respondent’ weights PB070) The design weights need to be defined for all selected units, not only for responding units. The household design weights aim to draw inference on the household population from the household sample. The design weight of a household (h) is the inverse of its inclusion probability. DB080 is computed as follows: In the case that households are sampled (or addresses or other units containing households): 𝐷𝐵080ℎ = 1 / (probability of selection of h) In the case that persons are sampled: 𝐷𝐵080ℎ = 1 /  (probabilities of selection of eligible persons in h) ‘Eligible persons’ are people who are given a non-zero probability in the selection procedure, such as people aged 16+. When the probability of selection is the same for all eligible people in each household, the denominator is simply the number of such people in the household multiplied by the probability of selection. From the second year onwards (case of a rotational panel) For the households which are not interviewed for the first time, no values are to be given for the design weight and these are to be flagged ‘-2’ (not applicable). In the weight section (8), a more extensive explanation on the weighting procedures is given. Further adjustments taking into consideration non-response or calibration are done DB080 (N). The design weights have to be inflated by the inverse of the response propensities in order to compensate for the loss of units in the sample. A classical procedure consists of modifying the design weights by a factor inversely proportional to the response rate within each ‘homogeneous group’, in which the response probabilities are assumed to be equal: 𝐷𝐵080ℎ (𝑁) = 𝐷𝐵080ℎ ⋅ 1 𝑅𝐾 Where RK denotes s the (weighted) response rate in the group (k) the household (h) belongs to: 𝑅𝐾   =  𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑒𝑙 𝑘 𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑘 See construction of weights in the first part of section 8: weights."
DB090,HOUSEHOLD CROSS-SECTIONAL WEIGHT,"The household cross-sectional weights are the final estimation weights. Only the households that are accepted into the database (DB135 = 1) have a cross-sectional weight; the others are assigned a weight of 0. The calibration is done taking all rotational groups together. Units of the sub-samples appear in the EU-SILC sample only in situations where a rotational design is used. In this case, sample weights are called ‘cross-sectional’ weights. These weights are required for all the types of units considered in the EU-SILC survey. The household cross-sectional weights (target variable DB090) will be used to draw inference on the population of private households at national and European levels (see the weight for DB080 and then further). After adjustments for non-response and to external sources (calibration) of the household design weight, the cross-sectional household weight (DB090) is calculated. DB090 is used to weigh household data and indicators produced at household level. More precisely, suppose that there are ‘J’ auxiliary variables x1…xj…xJ, called calibration variables, with known population totals (for the numerical variables) or marginal counts (for the categorical variables). Without loss of generality, we can assume that all the calibration variables are numerical (otherwise, we consider the 0/1 variables for each category). New household weights (DB090) are ‘as close as possible’ (as determined by a certain distance function) to the initial weights 𝐷𝐵080(𝑁). These new weights are calibrated on the totals Xj of the ‘J’ auxiliary variables; in other words, they verify the calibration equations: ∀𝑗 = 1 … 𝐽     ∑ 𝐷𝐵090𝑘 ⋅ 𝑥𝑗𝑘   =  𝑋𝑗 𝑘∈𝑠 . Where 𝐷𝐵090𝑘 = 𝑔𝑘 × 𝐷𝐵080(𝑁) This process can be done using different statistical software and different methods (e.g., logit regressions through the SAS macro, CALMAR)."
DB095,HOUSEHOLD LONGITUDINAL WEIGHT,"The household longitudinal weights are the final estimation weights. Only the households that are accepted into the database (DB135 = 1) have a longitudinal weight; the others are assigned a weight of 0. The calibration is done taking all rotational groups separately. The household longitudinal weight DB095 is a product of the first calibration of the population. In year X, after the non-response adjustment that is applied to each rotational group separately, each rotational group should be calibrated separately to the cross-sectional population referring to the end of the year X-1. The calibration should be done using the integrative calibration approach to ensure that each member of the same household receive the same weight. Household longitudinal weights are defined for all households accepted into the database. To combine the calibrated weights, they should be scaled based on the number of rotational groups in the longitudinal sample of the survey. A particular rotational group should be surveyed at least 2 consecutive years before being part of the longitudinal component. Each wave of the longitudinal component contains different numbers of rotational groups (3, 2 and 1). For this reason, household longitudinal weights should be scaled with different scaling factors for each year. The table29 below illustrates the scaling factors and the approximate target population. These weights will be part of D-file as well as part of the longitudinal data set delivered each year. The set consists of at least three panels of duration: 2, 3 and 4 years. The variable DB095 should be adjusted backwards with every data transmission because the number of surveyed rotational groups change with the evolution of the panel. The sum of all non-zero DB095 for year X should be approximately equal to sum of non-zero DB090 for that year. In the weights section, a more extensive explanation of the weighting procedures is given. 29 The table illustrates a classical EU-SILC rotational design with 4 rotational groups. If a country uses rotational design with different numbers of rotational groups the scaling factors should be adjusted accordingly."
DB100,DEGREE OF URBANISATION,"This variable reports on the degree of urbanisation in the area where the usual residence of the person or the household is located. From 2021 onwards the modalities were changed according to the standardised social variables. This variable must be filled in for every household in wave 1. From wave 2 onwards, a missing value (flag -1) is allowed in exceptional cases (like moving house). From 2021 onwards the variable classifies LAU2 into three types of area: 1. 'Cities' - densely-populated areas where at least 50% of the population live in an urban centre. 2. 'Towns and suburbs' - intermediate density areas where at least 50% of the population live in urban clusters, but which are not 'cities'. 3. 'Rural areas' - thinly populated areas where more than 50% of the population live in rural grid cells. This classification is based on a combination of criteria of geographical contiguity and minimum population threshold applied to 1 km2 population grid cells. The LAU2 list including the degree of urbanisation is published by Eurostat on the RAMON server: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/miscellaneous/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_DEGURBA. For further methodological details on the classification of LAU2s by degree of urbanisation, see http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/degree-of-urbanisation/methodology. For further information, see: Local Administrative Units (LAU) - NUTS - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics - Eurostat (europa.eu) Modalities used before: - Densely populated area: contiguous grid cells of 1km2 with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50,000. - Intermediate area: clusters of contiguous grid cells of 1km2 with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 5,000. - Thinly-populated area: Grid cells outside urban clusters."
DB110,HOUSEHOLD STATUS,"The household is at the same address as the last interview: This situation appears when at least one of the sample persons lives at the same address as in the previous wave. Entire household moved to a private household within the country: This situation appears when no sample persons live at the same address as in the previous wave, but when the household moved to a private household within the country. Entire household moved to a collective household or institution within the country: This situation appears when all the sample persons moved to a collective household or institution within the country. Household moved outside the country or to territories not covered by the survey: This situation appears when all the sample persons moved outside the country or to territories not covered by the survey. Entire household deceased: This situation occurs when all the sample persons have died. Household does not contain sample person: This situation occurs when sample persons are no longer in scope for a variety of reasons. Address non-contacted: This category distinguishes between households that cannot be accessed and households that are ‘lost’, i.e. no information on record as to what happened to the household. Split-off households: New household which has split off from the initial household since the previous wave and now considered as a separate household. New address added to the sample in this wave or first wave: This situation occurs where for the first time this household is recorded in the survey and is not a split-off household (first wave, new household introduced into the sample in order to maintain the sample size because of loss due to non-response). Fusion: This situation occurs when sample persons from different sample households from the previous wave join together to form a new household. The household that disappears will be coded as ‘fusion household’ while the other one is considered as the main household and keeps the identification number. The household that keeps the identification number will be coded as: ‘1’ (if it remains at the same address as in"
DB120,CONTACT AT ADDRESS,"This variable needs to be filled in only when DB110 = ‘2’, ‘8’, or ‘9’. Otherwise, no values are to be given for this variable and it must be flagged ‘-2’ (not applicable). 11 Address contacted/phone should be used when: - a household has its main residence at the sampled address which can be located and accessed. - an entire household, or a part of the household (split-off household) has moved to a private household within the country and the new address can be accessed. - Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is used, and the phone number is available. 21 Address/phone non-contacted: not located/not found should be recorded when: - it is not possible to locate the address despite special efforts being made to do so. - the CATI method is used and the phone number of that household could not be found. 22 Address/phone non-contacted: unable to access should be recorded when: - it is not possible to access the address due to weather factors (like flooding, etc.) or geographic factors, for example, there may be no access roads. The factor causing the lack of access should not be only temporary. - the CATI method is used and the number cannot be reached. 23 Address/phone non-contacted: non-existent/non-residential or non-private/unoccupied/not principal residence should be recorded when: - an address is non-residential if it is used for different purposes than those of a principal residence (business, shop, vacation home, etc.). - an address does not exist if the building has been demolished. - an address is unoccupied or empty if nobody is currently living there. - a CATI interview is used and a phone number does not exist or the phone belongs to a company, shop, hotel, etc. For those countries selecting a sample of persons, such as one from a population register, the goal is to contact these people wherever they live. The status ‘address does not exist, is non-residential, is unoccupied or is not principal residence’ should not be relevant. In the case of death of the selected respondent, the household can be classified as ‘address is unoccupied’."
DB130,HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE RESULT,"This variable needs to be filled in only when DB120 = 11 or when DB110 = 1. Otherwise, no values are to be given for this variable and it must be flagged ‘-2’ (not applicable). The information is collected for each address contacted if the household questionnaire is completed, refused, entire household is temporary away, household is unable to respond or the questionnaire is not completed for other reasons. 11 Household questionnaire completed: A household questionnaire is considered as completed if most of its variables have been filled in. 21-24 Interview not completed: In the case of an interview survey, at least three call-backs must be made before a household is considered as being non-responsive (interview not completed), unless there are clear reasons (such as a definite refusal to cooperate, circumstances endangering the safety of the interviewer, etc.) why this household cannot be interviewed. The interview has not been completed for some of the following reasons: 21 Refusal to cooperate The household refuses to give information either from the beginning of the interview or having initially agreed to provide the information, refuses to do so at a later date (for any reason). The interviewers should do their best to get cooperation not only by explaining the survey, but also by calling back again when an appointment is broken. 22 Entire household temporarily away for duration of fieldwork An entire household is temporarily away when all its household members are temporarily away and will not return during the period when fieldwork is being carried out in the area. Before declaring a household as being temporarily away, the interviewer must ensure that all necessary attempts to contact the household have been made (visiting the household at different hours, different days, calling by phone, etc.). 23 Household unable to respond (illness, incapacity, etc.) This situation appears when either all household members are unable to respond to the interview or are unable to self-administer the questionnaires due to incapacity, illness etc. In the case where a one-person household is unable to respond to or self-administer the questionnaire due to incapacity or illness, the interviewer should, if feasible, try to contact someone outside the household who is able to help or provide the information on behalf of the incapacitated person. The interviewer must only assign the code ‘household unable to respond’ when the illness or incapacity is not temporary; where the illness or incapacity is temporary, the interviewer should return to the household during the period when fieldwork is being carried out in the area."
DB135,HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW ACCEPTANCE,"The interview must be accepted for the database if at least one of the personal interviews is completed. In those countries for which a selected respondent is chosen for the personal interview, the interview of the selected respondent must be completed."
HB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"Year in which the survey data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
HB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,"The country of residence is the country in which the person/household has his/her usual residence. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The SCL GEO is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CL_G EO&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC. Information on the country of residence should be obtained in accordance with the current national boundaries. To the extent to which all possible participants in a specific social micro data-collection need to be usual residents, and the country of residence of all the reporting units corresponds to the reporting country. Consequently, a reference question is not needed for this variable. Country of residence with the year and ID, is an important variable used as key to merge different files."
HB030,HOUSEHOLD ID,"Every household will receive a household number. This number is the base upon which to construct the Household ID and the Personal ID. It should be a sequential number and should not contain other information. It must NOT contain any information that conflicts with confidentiality rules. This number must be unique for all the years of the survey. This number is used as a key variable for analysis purpose, for sampling, tracking rules and followed up. Household ID (maximum nine digits) = Household number (maximum seven digits) + split number (two digits) The split number for the first wave will always take value ‘00’. In the case of the household remaining entire, it keeps the Household number and Split number from one wave to the next. In the case of a split-off, the initial household will keep the Household number and Split number from one wave to the next. The other households, i.e. the split-off households will keep the same Household number, but will be assigned the next available unique Split number in sequence. In the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at a previous address, it must retain the Household number and Split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave. If the new household is at a new address, the Household number and Split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ will be retained."
HB040,DAY OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,"‘Day of household interview’ means the day in which the data are collected, or the household is interviewed."
HB050,MONTH OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,"‘Month of household interview’ means the month in which the data are collected, or the household is interviewed."
HB060,YEAR OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,‘Year of household interview’ means the year in which the data is collected or the household is interviewed.
HB070,PERSON RESPONDING TO THE HOUSEHOLD,"The household respondent is the person from whom household-level information is obtained. Given that the household-level response is going to be attributed to all household members, it is essential that the information be collected from someone who can, in some sense, ‘speak for’ the household. For instance, if the ‘selected respondent’ is the 16-year old son or daughter, this person is highly unlikely to be able to provide good quality information on such issues as mortgage or rent payments, housing costs, income from family and other benefits. The household respondent will be chosen according to the following priorities: Priority (1): the person responsible for the accommodation Priority (2): a household member aged 16 and over who is the best placed to provide the information. For the second and following waves, the household respondent will be chosen according to the following list of priority: Priority (1): the household respondent in the last wave Priority (2): a ‘sample person’ aged 16 and over giving priority to the person responsible for the accommodation or the best placed to provide the information. Priority (3): a ‘non-sample person’ aged 16 and over."
HB100,NUMBER OF MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE,The value of this variable refers to the count of minutes required to fill the household interview.
HB110,HOUSEHOLD TYPE,"The household grid (R file variables - RG_Z#: GRID) provides basic information for constructing this variable. This variable was introduced as part of the list of standardised variables and will be implemented from 2021 onwards. Therefore, in those cases where the grid or the age of children is missing this variable should have the value missing and the flag ‘-1’ should be filled. Household type is defined by a private household composition, where: - A 'couple' is defined as a pair of individuals considered as partners in terms of their actual living arrangements within the household, regardless of whether the relationship with the partner is legally registered (e.g., marriage or civil union) or a de facto relationship (cohabiting partners). - The term 'child(ren)' refers to the presence of son(s) or daughter(s) in the household, either natural/adopted or stepson/stepdaughter. 'Natural/adopted son/daughter or stepson/stepdaughter' refers to a natural (biological), adopted or step member of the family (regardless of age or partnership/relationship status) who has usual residence in the household of at least one of the parents. 'Adoption' means taking and treating a biological child of other parents as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country whereby means of a judicial process the adopted child - whether related or not to the adopter - acquires the rights and status of a biological child born to the adopting parents. 'Stepson/stepdaughter' refers to a situation in which a stepparent treats the child of his/her partner as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country, without adopting it; and foster children and children-in-law are not covered by this category. - A 'lone parent' is a parent not living with a (legal or de facto) partner in the same household who has most of the day-to-day responsibilities in raising the child or children. - Other type of households are those which do not fall in any of the above categories."
HB120,HOUSEHOLD SIZE,"The household grid will provide basic information for constructing this variable. The variable should take into consideration current situation (moving out and moving in, died, born, etc.). It will count all current household members, RB110: MEMBERSHIP STATUS=1, 2, 3 or 4. The variable reports on the number of members of a private household. This variable is introduced as part of the list of standardised variables and will be implemented from 2021 onwards. When the information is collected during the interview the recommended question should be: ""How many people usually live in your household? Please include yourself."""
HB130,INTERVIEW MODE USED (HOUSEHOLD),"This variable is standardised variable. It will be implemented from 2021 onwards. The category concepts describe the interviewing mode (more predominantly) used to collect information from the respondent, whether PAPI, CAPI, CATI, CAWI, or other. The variable aims to collect the interview mode used for household questionnaire. When some variables are collected from administrative data and the main interview is done using CAPI mode then option ‘2’ Computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) should be recorded. The variable for personal interview time is included in P file - PB120: minutes to complete the personal questionnaire. The category 'other' is to be chosen when the interviewing mode used is not covered by the given variable categories, e.g. paper assisted self-administered interview (PASI), or non-web-based computer assisted self- administered interview (CASI). For example, information may have been collected combining interview data with data obtained from registers (i.e. administrative data) or imputed data. In addition, different interviewing modes may as well be combined (i.e. mixed-mode interview). In such cases, the interviewing mode more predominantly used should be reported. For example, in a situation where a person has been first contacted by phone and some data (main part) has been collected via computer assisted web-interview (CAWI) but the missing data (remaining part) is collected at a later stage via computer assisted personal interview (CAPI), the variable should report on CAWI as the interviewing mode used. Specific rules concerning quality reporting may be provided for each micro-data collection. When administrative and survey data and/or different interviewing modes are combined–, it is recommended to retain the information on the data collection method and on the interviewing mode used at the variable level. This will help assessing impact of the interviewing mode on the survey results."
HH010,DWELLING TYPE,"This variable is standardised variable. Building: A building is defined as any independent structure containing one or more dwellings, rooms or other spaces, covered by a roof and enclosed within external walls or dividing walls which extend from the foundations to the roof. Thus, a building may be a detached dwelling, apartment building, etc. It is recommended that countries follow the former practice by counting each house in the row house unit as an individual building. Dwelling is generally defined as a room or suite of rooms and its accessories (e.g., lobbies, corridors) in a permanent building or structurally separated part thereof, which, by the way it has been built, rebuilt or converted, is designed for habitation by one private household. It should have separate access to the street, direct or via a garden or grounds, or to a common space within the building (staircase, passage, gallery, etc.), but it does not necessarily need to have a bathroom or toilet available for the exclusive use of its occupants. Accommodations that are situated in buildings that are for use other than housing (schools,…) and fixed habitation like a hut or a cave are included. A building with two entrances will be considered as one single building if one can access all apartments from both entrances; otherwise, it will be two separate buildings. House: House means that no internal space or maintenance and other services are normally shared with other dwellings. Sharing of a garden or other exterior areas is not precluded. Detached: Detached means the dwelling has no common walls with another dwelling. If it is a separate building, without any common walls or celling with other dwelling is counted as a detached house. Semi-detached: Semi-detached refers to two dwellings sharing at least one wall, and ‘terraced’ refers to a row of (more than two) joined-up dwellings, we would consider houses in which are more than one dwelling, sharing at least one wall (or ceiling) but have separate entrances. Apartments or flats: Apartments or flats in a building normally share some internal space or maintenance and other services with other units in the building. Apartments or flats in a building normally share some internal space or maintenance and other services with other units in the building. Commonly there is also shared entrance to the building as such. Other kind of accommodation: Other kinds of accommodation include accommodations that are situated in buildings that are for use other than housing (i.e., schools) and fixed habitations like a hut or a cave."
HH021,TENURE STATUS,"This variable is a standardised variable. From the 2010 operation onwards, it replaces the variable HH02030. Ownership: The owner of the accommodation should be a member of the household. If for instance the accommodation is provided by a relative (such as by parents to their children) who is not a member of the household, then one of the other categories should be selected, depending on whether or not rent is paid by this household. A person is an owner if he/she possesses a title deed independently of whether the house is fully paid or not. A reversionary owner should be considered as the owner. In both variables HH070 and HH021 mortgage is taken into account only when it has been taken for the purpose of purchasing main dwelling. Outright owner: The owner is considered as 'outright owner' when he/she has no mortgage to pay for his/her main dwelling. An owner who has a mortgage only for a second dwelling and/or for repairs, renovation, maintenance, etc. should be treated as 'outright owner'. Owner paying mortgage: An owner is considered as an 'owner paying mortgage' when he/she has to pay 30 An agreement was made at the Living Conditions Working Group meeting in June 2009 that the variable HH020 will be replaced by the variable HH021 with five answer categories. In 2010, the LC WG agreed to suppress HH020 and to keep only HH021 from the 2011 operation onwards."
HH030,NUMBER OF ROOMS AVAILABLE TO THE,"Room: A room is defined as a space of a housing unit of at least four square meters such as bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms and habitable cellars, attics, kitchens and other separated spaces used or intended for dwelling purposes with a height over two meters and accessible from inside the unit. Kitchens are only excluded if the space is used only for cooking. A single room used as kitchen-cum-dining room is included as one room in the count of rooms. The following space of a housing unit does not count as a room: bathroom, toilet, corridor, utility room, lobby and veranda. A room used solely for business use is excluded but is included if shared between private and business use. If the dwelling is shared by more than one household and some rooms are shared with other households (within the same dwelling), the number of shared rooms should be divided by the number of households and the equal share should be added to each household. This variable can consequently be coded with one decimal. In the case of several households sharing a unique room, the variable is coded to ‘1’ (zero is difficulty interpretable). This variable is supposed to collect only the first wave households and to be reported annually. In such cases that the household has moved from the previous address this information should also be collected even for the households in the new address. Suggested question: How many rooms does your household have altogether in your main residence that is excluding kitchen, bathrooms, toilets, corridors and lobby? (A room is defined as a space of at least four square meter in a housing unit)."
HH050,ABILITY TO KEEP HOME ADEQUATELY WARM,"This question is about affordability (ability to pay) to keep the home adequately warm, regardless of whether the household actually needs to keep it adequately warm. Suggested question is: Can your household afford to keep its home adequately warm?"
HH060,CURRENT RENT RELATED TO THE OCCUPIED,"The variable refers to the total monthly rent that is currently paid for the main residence of the household. The rent refers to the monthly amount paid for the use of an unfurnished dwelling. Rentals also include payments for the use of a garage to provide parking in connection with the dwelling. Other payments which are made at the same time as the rent (such as for electricity, heating etc.), should be excluded. Regular repairs and maintenance and other services related to the dwelling should also be excluded. Only rent related to the principal residence is taken into account. In cases where part of the rent may be paid through a housing benefit (either paid to the tenant or paid directly to the landlord), the rent paid refers to the total rent payable: that is to the amount paid by the tenant from his or her own income plus the amount paid by housing benefit. For example, if: • The owner requires a rent for the dwelling: 700 € • The household pays the owner (from their own resources): 500 € • The housing allowances (paid directly to the owner or through the household): 200 € (recorded as a part of appropriate housing allowances variables) then: HH060 = 700 €  (= 500 € + 200€), The amount provided should be in the national currency. Suggested question: What was the total amount your household was due to pay for rent for the main residence in the last month? (it should not include payment for any of the following services: electricity, gas, water, oil/solid fuel or heating)"
HH070,TOTAL HOUSING COST,"The term housing cost refers to monthly costs connected with the household’s right to live in the accommodation. The costs of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating) resulting from the actual use of the accommodation are also included. Only housing costs that are actually paid are taken into account (regardless of who covers it). Components that must be included in housing costs: Owners: Mortgage interest payments32 (net of any tax relief), gross of housing benefits (i.e. housing benefits should not be deducted from the total housing cost), structural insurance, mandatory services and charges (sewage removal, refuse removal, etc.), regular maintenance and repairs33, taxes, and the cost of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating). Tenants (at market price): Rental payments, gross of housing benefits (i.e. housing benefits should not be deducted from the total housing cost), structural insurance (if paid by the tenants), services and charges (sewage removal, refuse removal, etc.) (if paid by the tenants), taxes on dwelling (if applicable), regular maintenance and repairs28  and the cost of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating). Tenants (at reduced price): Rental payments, gross of housing benefits (i.e. housing benefits should not be deducted from the total housing cost), structural insurance (if paid by the tenants), services and charges (sewage removal, refuse removal, etc.) (if paid by the tenants), taxes on dwelling (if applicable), regular maintenance and repairs and the cost of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating). Rent free: gross of housing benefits (i.e. housing benefits should not be deducted from the total housing cost), structural insurance (if paid by the rent-free tenant), services and charges (sewage removal, refuse removal, etc.) (if paid by the rent-free tenant), taxes on dwelling (if applicable), regular maintenance and repairs and the cost of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating). For example, in the case of tenants at reduced price, if: • The household has to pay for the charges (electricity, water, etc.): 300 € • The owner requires a rent for the dwelling: 700 € • The household pays the owner (from their own resources): 500 € • The housing allowances are paid directly to the owner or through the household: 200 € 32 Included only in case of mortgage taken for the purpose of buying the main dwelling 33 Only the regular maintenance and repairs should be included. According to the COICOP/HBS: ‘regular maintenance or repairs of the dwelling are distinguished by two features: first, they are activities that have to be undertaken regularly in order to maintain the dwelling in good working order; second, they do not change the dwelling’s performance, capacity or expected service life.’"
HH071,MORTGAGE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT,"The term mortgage principal repayment (net of any tax relief) refers to monthly payments connected with the households' total housing cost. The same definition applies for including the mortgage or not as for variable HH070. The repayments will be included only when a mortgage is taken for the purpose of buying the main dwelling. Mortgages taken for other purpose then purchasing main dwelling should be excluded. Mortgage interest payments and other mortgage payments, such as mortgage protection insurance, should be excluded. Only those amounts that are actually paid have to be taken into account. The HH071 is relevant only for households who are paying the mortgage for their main dwelling or HH021 equal to ‘2’."
HS011,ARREARS ON MORTGAGE OR RENTAL,"This variable replaces, from the 2008 operation onwards the variable HS01034. The variable records whether the household has been in arrears in the past 12 months, that is, was unable to pay on time (as scheduled) the rent and/or the mortgage payment for the main dwelling. Only situations when household was unable to cover the costs due to financial difficulties should be recorded. If household was late with payment e.g. as forgot to pay the bill but had required amount of money, it should not be recorded. If the household manages to pay through borrowing (from bank, relatives or friends) it is considered in the same way as if the household had managed to pay using its own resources. Loans for decoration, maintenance, refurbishment etc. are excluded. However, loans concerning major repairs or other expenses in relation to the main dwelling which cannot be separated from the loan that was used to purchase or to build the main dwelling, could be included in variable HS011. Under these circumstances, the focus is put on the risk for the household of losing its main dwelling (being evicted). Any other type of housing loan (e.g. related to the second dwelling), which is not included in the variable HS011, will be included in variable HS031. Suggested question: In the past twelve months, has the household been in arrears, i.e. has been unable to pay on time due to financial difficulties for: (a) rent 34 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS010 and to keep only HS011 starting from the 2011 operation."
HS021,ARREARS ON UTILITY BILLS,"This variable has replaced the variable HS02035 from the 2008 operation onwards. The variable records whether the household has been in arrears in the past 12 months, that is, unable to pay on time (as scheduled) utility bills (heating, electricity, gas, water, etc.) for the main dwelling. The question refers to financial difficulties, therefore, for example, if the household was unable to pay on time once/twice or more as result of lack of money, Only situations when household was unable to cover the costs due to financial difficulties should be recorded. If household was late with payment e.g. as forgot to pay the bill but had required amount of money, it should not be recorded.. Telephone bills should not be considered as utility bills in this item. However, sewage and rubbish bills are taken into account in this item. If the household manages to pay through borrowing (from bank, relatives or friends), it is considered the same as if the household had managed to pay through its own resources. If somebody from outside the household pays utility bill, flag -2 should be used36. The amount paid by other household should be recorded as a cost in HH070 but also as Regular inter household cash transfer received in HY080. Suggested question: In the past twelve months, has the household been in arrears, i.e. has been unable to pay the utility bills (e.g. heating, electricity, gas, water, waste disposal etc.) of the main dwelling on time due to financial difficulties? 35 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS020 and to keep only HS021 starting from the 2011 operation. 36 The Living Condition Working Group meeting on 24-25 October 2017"
HS022,REDUCED UTILITY COSTS,HS022 is introduced from 2021 onwards. The aim of this variable is to collect information if the household has their utility cost reduced or fully covered by central/local government or NPISHs. The reduction could be for one item (e.g. electricity) or all of them. Even when household has subsidised one type of utility cost the answer 1 yes should be selected. If other household covers part of the utility costs it should be not considered in this variable. Not in all countries exist governmental schemes which reduce or cover the cost of utility bills for some groups of population. When it is not applicable in the country flag -2 should be used.
HS031,ARREARS ON HIRE PURCHASE INSTALMENTS OR,"This variable replaces the variable HS03037 from the 2008 operation onwards. The variable records whether the household has been in arrears in the past 12 months, that is, unable to pay on time (as scheduled) repayments for hire purchase or other non-housing loans. Other loans include all types of commercial credits, for instance for decoration, maintenance, refurbishment, credit cards/ store cards, catalogue mail order, loans of any kind of for technical equipment (i.e,. cars, motorcycles), housing equipment, education loans, holidays (holiday packages plus time-share holidays). Only situations when household was unable to cover the costs due to financial difficulties should be recorded. If household was late with payment e.g,. as forgot to pay the bill but had required amount of money, it should not be recorded. For further information or required technical details, a bank overdraft and a negative balance at the ""end of the month statement"" should not, normally, enter into consideration when estimating the arrears status of the household except if not paying has direct consequence for the household situation (fine, disruption of service in case the household does not ensure minimum/full repayment). Mortgage instalments for the main dwelling are excluded. Suggested question: In the past twelve months, has the household been in arrears on hire purchase instalments or other loan payments (for example, a car loan, consumer bills, bills from day-care, school, health…), i.e., has been unable to pay these on time due to financial difficulties? 37 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS030 and to keep only HS031 starting from the 2011 operation."
HS040,CAPACITY TO AFFORD PAYING FOR ONE WEEK,"This question focuses mainly on the affordability of some aspects of living standards. The wording of the question refers to the affordability and to the actual meaning ‘ability to pay’ i.e. ‘the household has the resources to afford…’ regardless of whether the household wants it. The answer is ‘YES’ if, according to the household respondent, the whole household can afford to go for a week’s annual holiday away from home. If the household can (only) afford holidays by using its ‘social network’ (friends, etc.) or can afford subsidised holidays (government schemes), or its second dwelling, the answer should be ‘YES’. These cases are included in this particular variable because it is not possible to specify the amount that is required for a household to have a week’s holiday every year; in many cases, where the household makes use of its second dwelling for holidays or stays with friends, it could still generate cost and also, the case of subsidized holidays is in fact considered as an ‘invisible’ part of the household’s income. Cases where the household cannot go e.g. because of ‘shortage of time’ are not included (the answer should be ‘YES’). If at least one household member cannot afford to go for holidays, the answer should be ‘NO’ (e.g. when parents can afford to send children to a summer camp but cannot afford to go for a holiday for themselves, or when a grown-up son or daughter can afford a holiday but other household members cannot). Please note that in such cases where the household contains elderly members or members with health problems who have the resources to afford a week's annual holiday but for other reasons they cannot go or follow the other members of the household, the answer should be ‘YES’. ‘Whole household’ does not mean that the members of the household have to go on holiday all together and at the same time. If the household finances its holidays through borrowing (from bank, relatives or friends) it is considered in the same way as if the household manages to pay through its own resources. ‘One week’ means seven days. Suggested question: Can your entire household afford to go for a week's annual holiday, away from home, including stays in a second dwelling or with friends/relatives? [Note for the interviewer: ‘Entire household’ does not mean that the members of the household have to go on holiday all together and at the same time]."
HS050,"CAPACITY TO AFFORD A MEAL WITH MEAT,","The variable records whether, according to the household respondent, the household can afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish or equivalent vegetarian every second day, regardless if the household wants it. If the household manages to pay through borrowing (from bank, relatives or friends) it is considered in the same way as if the household manages to pay through its own resources. If at least one household member cannot afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish or equivalent vegetarian every second day, regardless if the household wants it, the answer should be ‘NO’ (e.g. when parents can afford the refereed meal for the children but cannot afford it for themselves, or when a grown-up son or daughter can afford the refereed meal but other household members cannot). Suggested question: Can your household afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish or vegetarian equivalent every second day?"
HS060,CAPACITY TO FACE UNEXPECTED FINANCIAL,"The variable records whether, according to the household respondent, the household can face itself unexpected financial expenses. ‘Own resources’ means: • Your household does not ask for financial help from anybody; • Your account has to be debited within the required period; • Your situation regarding potential debts is not deteriorated. You do not pay through own resources if you pay in instalments (or by taking a loan) expenses that you previously used to pay in cash. Required expenses: A required expense could be different across countries but examples are surgery, a funeral, major repairs in the house, replacement of durables like washing machine, car. For the calculation of the amount that should be filled in the questionnaire, the national at-risk-of-poverty threshold has to be used per single consumption unit, which means it has to be used independently of the size and structure of the household. A ratio of 1/12 of the above value is used in the questionnaire. This value can be rounded but the difference between calculated value and rounded value cannot exceed 5% (for example; a calculated value of 136 can be rounded to 140 but not to 150). The calculation for year ‘n’ comes from year ‘n-2’ EU-SILC data. For year 1 and 2, appropriate national data has to be used. Suggested question: Can your household afford an unexpected required expense (amount to be filled) and pay through its own resources? Yes/No"
HS090,DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER,"The variable records whether the household has a computer or whether the household does not have a computer because it cannot afford it (enforced lack) or for other reasons. ‘Enforced lack’ implies that the item is something that the household would like to have but cannot afford. Possessing the item does not necessarily imply ownership: the item may be rented, leased, provided on loan or shared with other households in (e.g.) a complex apartment and not necessarily owned. If the item is shared between households, the answer is ‘YES’ if there is adequate/easy access (i.e., household can use the durable whenever it wants) and ‘NO’ otherwise. In the case of a computer, the household is considered to possess it if any member possesses it. A computer includes a portable computer or a desktop computer but does not include machines dedicated to video games that do not have any broader functionality. If a computer is provided ONLY for work purposes, this does not count as possessing the item. Suggested question: Does your household have a computer? If you do not have a computer: • Would you like to have it but cannot afford it, or • Do you not have one for other reasons e.g., you do not want it or need it."
HS110,DO YOU HAVE A CAR,"The variable records whether the household has a car or whether the household does not have a car because it cannot afford it (enforced lack) or for other reasons. ‘Enforced lack’ implies that the item is something that the household would like to have but cannot afford. Possessing the item does not necessarily imply ownership: the item may be rented, leased, provided on loan, or shared with other households. If the item is shared between households, the answer is ‘YES’ if there is adequate/easy access (i.e., household can use the durable whenever it wants) and ‘NO’ otherwise. In the case of owning a car, the household is considered to possess it if any member possesses it. A company car or van which is available to the household for private use counts as possessing the item. A car or van provided ONLY for professional purposes, should not be considered as possessing the item. Motorcycles are excluded. Suggested question: Does your household have a car/van for private use? If you do not have a car/van: (a) Would you like to have it but cannot afford it, or (b) Do you not have one for other reasons e.g. you do not want it or need it."
HS120,ABILITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET,"The objective is to assess the respondents’ feeling about the level of difficulty experienced by the household in making ends meet. The respondent's assessment should be based on the household’s total income. There should be a reference in the national questionnaires as well as in the interviewers' guidelines that all income sources are to be taken into account (possibly irregular) and that ‘more than one household member may contribute to it’. It is however acceptable that this reference is dropped if this question follows other questions on the household’s total income and the concept is clear to respondents. Additionally, in the guidelines for interviewers, it can be specified that income refers to ‘net’ income i.e. to income after the deduction of tax and social insurance. As ‘making ends meet’ does not exist in some languages, it is to be defined as paying usual necessary expenses and should be included both in the national questionnaires and in the guidelines for interviewers. The usual necessary expenses of the household should include housing related costs but exclude business and farm work costs. This clarification is to be given in the interviewers' guidelines. In order to guarantee the maximum comparability between countries should use the same scale proposed in the given order. Suggested question: A household may have different sources of income and more than one household member may contribute to it. Thinking of your household's total income, is your household able to make ends meet, namely, to pay for its usual necessary expenses?"
HS150,FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE REPAYMENT OF,"The objective is to assess the respondent’s feeling about the extent to which the repayment of non-housing related debts are a financial burden to the household. That should be clearly indicated/specified both in the national questionnaires and in the related interviewers' guidelines. 'Non-housing related debts' include any loans for consumer items or services (car, holiday, furniture, durable etc.) and credit card debt. Mortgage repayments or loans connected with the purchase of the main dwelling are excluded. Suggested question: 'Do you or anyone in your household' should be explicitly mentioned in the questionnaire and the interviewers’ explanatory notes. Do you or anyone in your household have to repay debts from any credit card, hire purchase or other loans (that is, excluding mortgage repayments or other loans connected with the purchase of main dwelling)? If yes, to what extent is the repayment of such loans a financial burden for your household? Would you say it is: a) A heavy burden; b) Somewhat a burden; c) Not a burden at all"
HD080,REPLACING WORN-OUT FURNITURE,"The aim of this variable is to collect information if the household could afford to replace furniture when needed (if they are worn out, damaged, broken or out of use) by new or second-hand furniture, not on the intention to replace them during specified reference period. Proposed question: Could you tell me if your household replaces furniture (bed, sofa/dresser, cupboard) when worn out or damaged? 38 Part of additional variables for material deprivation on annex 2013 operation (ESS Agreement of September 2012)"
HI010,CHANGE IN THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,"The income considered is the net total income of the household. It can be based on respondent’s feeling about the change in income. Suggested question: In the past 12 months, how has your total household income changed? 1 Increased 2 Remained the same 3 Decreased Go to HI020 if HI010=1 Go to HI040 if HI010=2 Go to HI030 if HI010=3"
HI020,REASON FOR INCREASE IN INCOME,"Provided reasons refer to change in the degree of occupation, normal life transitions (came back to job market after parenthood, parental leave), household composition change as well as changes related to indexation or social transfers. If there is more than one reason for increase in household income, respondent should select the main reason. Main reason is the reason which to the greatest extent increased the household income. Suggested question: What was the reason why your household income increased? If there is more than one reason, please choose the most important one: 1 Indexation/ re-evaluation of salary 2 Increased working time/wage or salary (same job) 3 Come back to job market after illness, parenthood, parental leave, child care or to take care of a person with illness or disability 4 Starting or changed job 5 Change in household composition 6 Increase in social benefits 7 Other"
HI030,REASON FOR DECREASE IN INCOME,"Provided reasons refer to change in the degree of occupation, normal life transitions (having children, retirement), household composition change as well as changes related to social transfers. If there is more than one reason for decrease in household income, respondent should select the main reason. Main reason is the reason which to the greatest extent decreased the household income. Suggested question: What was the reason your income decreased? If there is more than one reason, please choose the most important one: 1 Reduced working time/ wage or salary (same job), including self-employment (involuntary) 2 Parenthood/parental leave/child care/to take care of a person with illness or disability 3 Changed job 4 Lost job/unemployment/bankruptcy of (own) enterprise 5 Became unable to work because of illness or disability 6 Divorce/partnership ended /other change to household composition 7 Retirement 8 Cut in social benefits 9 Other"
HI040,EXPECTATION OF THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN,"Based on respondent’s (subjective) opinion. Suggested question: When you think of the next 12 months, do you expect the household income to: 1. Improve 2. Remain the same 3. Deteriorate"
HY010,TOTAL HOUSEHOLD GROSS INCOME,Before 2011: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are not included in the total household gross income (HY010). From 2011 onwards: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total household gross income (HY010). Inclusion of PY080 in HY010 should be implemented by countries from the 2011 operation onwards.
HY020,TOTAL DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,"Before 2011: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are not included in the total disposable household income (HY020). From 2011 onwards: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/(PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total disposable household income (HY020). Inclusion of PY080 in HY020, HY022 and HY023 should be implemented by countries from the 2011 operation onwards."

RB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"Year in which the survey data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
RB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,"The country of residence is the country in which the usual residence of the household/person is located. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The SCL GEO is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CL_G EO&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC. Information on the country of residence should be obtained in accordance with the current national borders. Country code, year and IDs are used as key variables to merge different files."
RB030,PERSONAL ID,Personal ID (maximum eleven digits) = Household ID (maximum nine digits) + personal number (two digits) Personal number: for every new person in the household add 1 to the highest-used persons number (for all the years of the survey and the Household ID) It refers to the number assigned in ‘the household register’ to the person the first time that he/she is recorded as a household member. It should correspond to the person’s line position in ‘the household register’.
RB032,SEQUENTIAL NUMBER OF THE PERSONS IN THE,Sequential number of the persons in the household. The number should be unique for each current household member.

RB040,CURRENT HOUSEHOLD IDENTIFICATION (ID),"Every household in the sample is allocated a household number. This number is the base upon which to construct the Household ID and the Personal ID. It should be a sequential number and should not contain other information. It must NOT contain any information that conflicts with confidentiality rules. This number must be unique for all the years of the survey. Household ID (maximum nine digits) = Household number (maximum seven digits) + split number (two digits) When there is no change in the household composition between waves, it keeps the Household number and Split number from one wave to the next. In the case of a split-off, the initial household will keep the Household number and Split number from one wave to the next. The other households, i.e. the split-off households will keep the same Household number, but will be assigned the next available unique Split number in sequence. In the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at a previous address, it shall retain the Household number and Split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave. If the new household is at a new address, the Household number and Split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ will be retained."

RB080,YEAR OF BIRTH,"Year of birth together with the passing of birthday and reference date of the interview gives information needed to calculate age. When asking for the passing of birthday at the time of the interview, the following questions are recommended: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" At data collection level, the exact date of birth might be asked directly to the respondents. In this case the recommended question is: ""What is your date of birth?"" (DD/MM/YYYY). This variable is supposed to be collected during the first interview (the first wave), however needs to be transmitted to Eurostat annually. 1890 − year of the survey"
RB081,AGE IN COMPLETED YEARS (AT THE END OF,"RB081 records the age at the end of the income reference period. The EU-SILC has two reference dates used for defining person’s age in completed years: end of income reference period (RB081) and the date of interview (RB082). Age at the end of income reference period is used to define statistical population, sample person, etc. Age in completed years at the end of income reference period (end of previous calendar year or tax year) is the age of the person at his/her last birthday before the reference date. I.e. the interval of time between the date of birth and the date of end of the income reference period expressed in completed years. RB081 and RB082 are different for individuals who have their birthday before the date of the interview and is the same for individuals that have their birthday after the date of the interview. For example, respondent turns 35 years old on 29 May 2017 and the interview is conducted on 10 June 2017. He/she is 35 years old at the time of the interview (RB082=35). However, when referring to income reference period (in that case December 2016) respondent is 34 years old (RB081 =34). For example, respondent turns 35 years old on 29 September 2017 and the interview is conducted on 10 June 2017. He/she is 34 years old at the time of the interview (RB082=34) and when referring to income reference period (in that case December 2016) respondent is also 34 years old (RB081 =34). Children born after the end of reference income period should be recorded as ‘0’. Also, children that are months old at the end of income reference period should have the value ‘0’. The quality reporting related to the variable 'age in completed years' should contain information on the number of records for which information on the age in completed years is imputed and this imputed value should be reported in the flags. When asking whether the birthday has passed at the time of the interview, it is recommended to use the following question: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" Age"
RB082,AGE IN COMPLETED YEARS AT THE TIME OF THE,"Age in completed years at the time (date) of the interview is the interval of time between the date of birth and the date of the interview in completed years. The following information is to be collected under this variable: - Year of birth - Passing or not of the birthday at the reference date - Reference date RB082 records the age at the time of the interview. For example, the interview is conducted in June 2017, and the person had their birthday on 29 May 2017, turning 35 years old. He/she is 35 years old at the time of the interview (RB082=35). If the person has the birthday on 29 August 2017 and the interview is done on 10 June 2017 then the age at the time of interview (PB082) will be 34. The quality reporting related to the variable 'age in completed years' should contain information on the number of records for which information on the age in completed years is imputed and this imputed value should be reported in the flags. When asking whether the birthday has passed at the time of the interview, the following questions are recommended: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" In case the reference date is not the time of the interview, the question has to be adapted, clearly explaining which reference date the passing of birthday should refer to. At data collection level, the exact date of birth might be asked directly to the respondents. In this case the recommended question is: ""What is your date of birth?"" (DD/MM/YYYY). This variable is to be constructed from the following variables: Year of birth and passing of birthday. Age"
RB083,PASSING OF BIRTHDAY AT THE TIME OF THE,"This variable collects whether the person has already had his/her birthday that year. Use of the following questions are recommended: ""Have you already had your birthday this year?"" At data collection level, the exact date of birth might be asked directly to the respondents. In this case the recommended question is: ""What is your date of birth?"" (DD/MM/YYYY)."
RB090,SEX,"Sex is the combination of biological and physiological characteristics that define a person to be either male or female. In cases where the biological sex of a person is not known, the information may be replaced by either the information from administrative data or the self-declared sex (survey data). The quality reporting related to the variable 'sex' should contain information on the number of records where the sex is imputed. This variable is supposed to collect only during the first wave but be transmitted annually. In case of change the information transmitted should be updated. Depending on the data collection mode or information being available from administrative sources it might not be necessary to collect this information from respondents directly. The proposed question is the following: ""What is your sex?"" 1 2 Male Female"
RB100,SAMPLE PERSON OR CO-RESIDENT,"Sample persons: means a member of the private household in the initial sample who is at least 16 years old at the end of the income reference period. Initial sample: Refers to the sample of households or persons at the time it is selected for inclusion in EU- SILC. Age limit used to define sample persons: In the case of a four-year panel, this age limit shall not be 16 year or higher at the end of the income reference period. In countries with a four-year panel using a sample of addresses or of households, all household members aged 16 and over in the initial sample shall be sample persons. In countries with a four-year panel using a sample of persons, this shall involve the selection of at least one such person per household. For an initial sample of persons, the term applies only to the individuals selected (normally one per sample household). Co-residents or non-sample persons means a current household member other than a sample person. Sample household means a private household containing at least one sample person. Implementation For countries selecting a sample of households (addresses) and using the Eurostat integrated design, each sub-sample will be a panel and it will be followed over the course of four years. In the first wave of each four-year panel, all household members aged 16 and over will be a sample person. Household members aged less than 16 will be co-residents. In the second wave and so forth, the co-residents will be those household members that are aged less than 16 (at the moment of the sample selection) plus household members who joined a sample household after the first wave. 1 2 Sample person Co-resident 1 -1 Filled Missing"

Where a person regularly lives in more than one dwelling, the dwelling where that person spends the greater part of the year shall be taken to be his or her place of usual residence, regardless of whether it is located elsewhere within the country or abroad. Initial household means a sample household which has undergone a household split and where any sample person who lived in that household at the time of wave x still lives at the same address at the time of wave x+1. If more than one sample person lived in the household at the time of the wave x and still live in that address at the time of the wave x+1 but in different households, the initial household is the household of the sample person still living at the initial address who has the lowest person number referred to in Annex III. If at the time of wave x+1 no sample person lives at the address of wave x, then the household of the sample person who had the lowest person number at the time of wave x is the initial household.

RB200,RESIDENTIAL STATUS,"All people who are usually resident, irrespective of whether or not they are related to other members of the private household, shall be considered to be members of a multi-person private household if they share household income or household expenses with other household members. Flatmates or housemates occupying a housing unit on a house-sharing basis and sharing only house-related expenses, but not sharing household income, shall not be considered a part of a multi-person private household occupying this housing unit, even if they share some other subsidiary household expenses. Currently living in the household: A household member is currently living in the household. Temporarily absent: A household member is temporarily absent because he/she is: • In hospital/nursing home • In full-time educational institute • Military service or equivalent • Other institution (prison etc.) • Working out of town • On travel • Other reasons Particular cases in application of the concept of usual residence is defined in Article 4, Commission implementing regulation 2019/2181. 1 2 Currently living in the household Temporarily absent"
RB211,MAIN ACTIVITY STATUS (SELF-DEFINED),"The variable refers to a person’s own perception of his or her current main activity status. Self-perception means the variable shall capture how people perceive themselves, not how they meet certain objective criteria. When more than one status applies to the person, the respondent should select the category that best describes his/her situation. No criteria for that are specified but it could be determined by the status/activity with the most time spent. The main status refers to the current situation (situation at the moment of the data collection/interview). Registers as a source of information could be used in exceptional cases. In cases where respondents cannot choose one category, as several categories apply to them, the interviewer can provide some clarification. However, it should not be indicated, which category should be chosen, should not be given. For example: – Respondents can consider themselves being employed irrespective of their official labour market status, working time or kind of income from employment. Respondents helping in the family business, even if it is unpaid, can consider themselves as employed. Opposite can occur when a person who chooses another main activity status can also be in employment. For instance, people who regard themselves as full-time students or mainly fulfilling domestic tasks can have a job. – Respondents can see themselves as being unemployed irrespective of an official status or a registration with the public unemployment office. Unemployed persons can also have part-time or ad hoc jobs while seeking for a full-time job. – Respondents who are in various forms of vocational education or training that (partly) takes place at the work site can consider themselves as being in employment. This also applies to apprentices, as well as"

RB280,COUNTRY OF BIRTH,"The variable is part of standardised list of social variables. The country of birth of an individual is defined as the country of usual residence (in its current boundaries) of the individual’s mother at the time of delivery. Information on the country of birth is used to distinguish between native-born (born in the reporting country) and foreign-born (born in a country other than the reporting country) residents. Information on the country of birth should be obtained according to the current national boundaries and not according to the boundaries in place at the time of birth. More detailed information on the locality could be required if the boundaries of a country have changed. When data are collected by interview, the respondent can be asked additional questions. When data are derived from administrative registers, it is more difficult to ensure that the definition is followed. If detailed information on the mother’s place of usual residence exists in the register, the country of birth should be re- coded so that it is coded according to the current national borders. Particular care is needed in cases where national boundaries have changed and/or where previously existing countries have split to form two or more new countries. As noted in the UNECE 2020 census recommendations (par. 651), a person should not be regarded as foreign-born (i.e. recorded as born in a country other than the reporting country) simply because the national boundaries of the country of birth have changed. The following important exception to the general rule of considering the current borders might exist: a person whose mother’s place of usual residence was, at the time of his/her birth, part of the person’s actual country of origin (e.g. as indicated by his/her citizenship or current place of usual residence) but is not any more due to changed borders. In this case the country of birth can exceptionally be enumerated at the boundaries at the time of birth. The country of birth of a person, who was born during the mother’s short-term visit to a country other than her country of usual residence, should be the country where the mother had her place of usual residence. Only if information on the place of usual residence of the mother at the time of the birth is not available, the place where the birth took place should be reported. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The short list of country codes corresponding to Ramon (GEO) classification as defined in the annex of the guidelines for standardised variables is included in Annex 10."
RB285,DURATION OF STAY IN THE COUNTRY OF,"The variable describes the interval of time since the point in time when a person most recently established his/her usual residence in the reporting country, expressed in completed years. The category 'number of years in this country (since last establishing the place of usual residence in this country)' are integer numbers describing the time span between the point in time when a person most recently established his/her usual residence and the reference date, in completed years. The time span includes the lower limit and excludes the upper limit. For example, a person who has arrived on 1st of March 2011 shall be classified in the category '3 years' if interviewed in February 2015 but in the category '4 years' if interviewed in March 2015. The flag ‘-2-born in this country and never lived abroad for a period of at least 1 year' covers those persons who are native-born, i.e. born in the reporting country (see variable 'country of birth'), and have never had their usual residence in a country other than the reporting country for at least 1 year. The duration of stay refers to the current situation for the individual, i.e. the situation existing on the reference date. The reference date is specific to each social micro-data collection (see the implementation guidelines for variable 'age in completed years'). Information on the person's 'country of birth' (i.e. whether the person is native- or foreign-born) needs to be known prior to the collection of information for the variable 'duration of stay in the country of residence in completed years', as different questions need to be asked for the native-born and for the foreign-born. If the information on the 'country of birth' is not available (i.e. 'not stated'), the same questions as for the 'native- born' should be asked. The 'duration of stay in the country of residence in completed years' refers to the most recent arrival in the country of residence, that is, when the person last established his or her usual residence in the country, and not the year of first arrival in this country (i.e. the 'duration of stay in the country of residence in completed"
RB290,COUNTRY OF MAIN CITIZENSHIP,"The variable reports on the country of the person's main citizenship. Citizenship is defined as the particular legal bond between the individual and his/her State acquired by birth or naturalisation, whether by declaration, choice, option, marriage or other means according to the national legislation. It generally corresponds to the country that issues the passport. A person with two or more citizenships shall be allocated to only one country of citizenship, to be determined in the following order of precedence: 1. If one of the person's citizenship is the reporting country, it  shall be recorded as the country of main citizenship; 2. If the person does not have the citizenship of the reporting country but one of another Member State, it shall be the recorded as the person's main citizenship. 3. If the person does not have the citizenship of the reporting country but multiple citizenships of other countries, the person may choose which of his/her EU citizenships is to be recorded. 4. If the person does not have the citizenship of any Member State, the person may choose which of his/her citizenships is to be recorded. In other cases (e.g., dual citizenship where both countries are within the EU, but neither is the reporting country) the person may choose which country of citizenship is to be recorded. If the information on the person's country of citizenship is not available (e.g., in case the information is obtained from administrative sources), the reporting country may determine which country of citizenship is to be allocated. Information on the country of main citizenship is used to distinguish between national citizens (individuals having the citizenship of the reporting country), non-national citizens (individuals having the citizenship of a country other than the reporting country) and stateless persons. Citizenship shall refer to the current (at the time of the interview) national boundaries and not the boundaries at the time of the reference period. To apply this definition, information only on citizenship may be insufficient. More detailed information on the current country is needed if the boundaries of the have been changed. In the case of citizenships that no longer exist, the present-day borders of the country should be used. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2)."
RL010,EDUCATION AT PRE-SCHOOL,"Education at pre-school: Pre-school or equivalent (e.g. kindergarten, nursery school …). The educational classification to be used is ISCED Level 0. Special pre-schools or equivalents for children who have special needs (handicapped,…) shall be included in as far as they are considered as pre-school (level 0). If they are not, they shall not be reported here (reported for example in RL040 for day-care centre). The meals at (pre-)school shall be included in the number of hours for the usual days the child eats at (pre- )school. If more than 99 hours, the code 99 should be used. The hours shall be rounded to the nearest hour. If the child spends per week in the pre-school or equivalent less than one hour, then one hour is coded. Children stay over at pre-school during the lunch time: If during the lunch time, children are usually cared for by their parent at the school place (or elsewhere), these hours are not counted in the variables of childcare since their parents are present. If during lunch time they are usually cared for by other parents at the school place (or elsewhere), these should be classified in RL060 (if parents have not paid for this help). If during lunch time they are usually cared for by somebody belonging to the school organisation (e.g., canteen), the hours are classified in RL010/RL020. If during lunch time they are usually cared for by a nanny, grandmother, they should be classified in the other variables (RL040-050-060) depending on who is the usual carer. School transportation: The time spent on “school transportation” should be included in RL010/RL020 if someone belonging to the school organisation is taking care of the children during school transportation. If children are usually cared for by a nanny, grandmother, during “school transportation” they should be classified in the other variables (RL040-050-060) depending on the usual carer. Suggested question: During a usual week how many hours does your child spend in pre-school (or equivalent to a pre-primary service such as Kindergarten or Nursery School)? 0−99 Number of hours of education during a typical week"
RL020,EDUCATION AT COMPULSORY SCHOOL,"Education at compulsory school: “Compulsory” school shall be understood as a mean to separate school from pre-school, but all the school hours must be included; primary and eventually secondary schools shall be included (children up to 12 years old at the day of interview). The meals at (pre-)school shall be included in the number of hours for the usual days the child eats at (pre- )school. If more than 99 hours, the code used is 99. The hours shall be rounded to the nearest hour. If the child spends per week in the compulsory school less than one hour, then one hour should be recorded. Children stay over at primary school during the lunch time: If during the lunch time, children are usually cared for by their mother or father at the school place (or elsewhere), these hours are not counted in the variables of childcare since their parents are present. If during lunch time they are usually cared for by other parents at the school place (or elsewhere), these should be classified in RL060 (if parents not paid). If during lunch time they are usually cared for by somebody belonging to the school organisation (e.g., canteen), the hours are classified in RL010/RL020. If during lunch time they are usually cared for by a nanny, grandmother,…, they should be classified in the other variables (RL040-050-060) depending on the usual carer. School transportation: The time spent on “school transportation” should be included in RL010/RL020 if someone belonging to the school organisation is taking care of the children during school transportation. If children are usually cared for by a nanny, grandmother,…, during  “school transportation” they should be classified in the other variables (RL040-050-060) depending on the usual carer. In 2021 online lessons should not be included. Only number of hours a child spends in school (including during ‘school transportation’ and lunch break) during a typical week. If a typical week is not possible to establish due to different COVID- 19 measures and consequently hours vary considerably from week to week or month to month the average of the hours actually in school per week over the past four weeks could be used. Suggested question: During a usual week how many hours does your child spend in compulsory school (primary or secondary school)? 0−99 Number of hours of education during a typical week"
RL030,CHILDCARE AT CENTRE-BASED SERVICES,"This variable concerns only those children who are at pre-school or at school in the childcare reference period (RL010>0 or RL020>0). Centre-based services outside (pre-)school hours: only the hours of care before and after school should be reported. For example, a school-going child who does not go to school on Wednesday and who is cared for by a day-care centre: these hours of care shall be reported in RL040. The services may be on the school premises or elsewhere. Cultural and sporting activities outside school (here after school hours) such as a club, music lessons, etc. shall not be included as far as they are not used as a childcare service but rather for the child’s leisure. The hours shall be rounded to the nearest hour. If less than one hour, then one hour is coded. For children attending school in the morning and a centre in the afternoon, the hours in the centre are coded as RL030 (before/after school for school going children). Suggested question: During a usual week how many hours does your child spend at a centre - based child service outside school hours (before and/or after school even if it is at the school)? 0−99 Number of hours of education during a typical week"
RL040,CHILDCARE AT DAY-CARE CENTRE,"RL040 includes all kind of care organised/controlled by a structure (public, private). This means that the parents and the carer are not the only persons involved in the care, that there are no direct arrangements between the carer and the parents in the sense that there is an organised structure between them (which is often the carer’s employers). For example, a centred-base day care, organised family day care, a crèche, …. The place of the care can be a centre or the carer’s home (e.g. organised family care). This should also include the qualified childminders organised and controlled by a structure, even if they are directly paid by the parents, like the ‘assistante maternelle’ in France. These kinds of care are often delivered within the social welfare system especially for children under the age of three. RL040 corresponds to the care for children too young to be at school (or at pre-school) but also for children attending school (pre-school) and cared for a day per week when school is closed. The care can be full time or part time, even for few hours. Cultural and sporting activities (such as a club) shall not be included in as far as they are not used as a childcare service but instead for the child’s leisure. Special day-care for children with special needs is included. Suggested question: During a usual week how many hours does your child spend at a day-care centre (text. a crèche)? 0−99 Number of hours of education during a typical week"
RL050,CHILDCARE BY A PROFESSIONAL CHILD-MINDER,"In RL050 there are direct arrangements between the carer and the parents; there is no structure which organises or controls the care. Parents are often employers, pay the carer directly, but furthermore there are no controls over the qualification of the childminder by an organised structure. “Professional” childminder shall be understood as a person for whom looking after the child represents a job of work or paid activity.

RL060,"CHILDCARE BY GRAND-PARENTS, HOUSEHOLD","RL060 refers to unpaid care (free or informal arrangements such as exchange of services). In RL050 there are direct arrangements between the carer and the parents; there is no structure which organises or controls the care. Parents are often employers, pay the carer directly, but furthermore there are no controls over the qualification of the childminder by an organised structure. “Professional” childminder shall be understood as a person for whom looking after the child represents a job of work or paid activity. The term “professional” does not content a notion of qualification or of quality of the care. Babysitters and “au pairs” are also included here. The care can be at the child’s home or at the childminder’s home.

RL070,CHILDRENS’ CROSS-SECTIONAL WEIGHT FOR,"In the EU-SILC, in addition to the four usual types of units involved which are “household”, “household member”, “household member 16+” and “selected respondent”, “child” is another type of unit that needs to be considered for childcare data. The personal cross-sectional weight (applicable to all household members, of all ages (target variable RB050) may be used for the childcare data. However, the calculation of this weight probably does not take into account external control age-distributions for children aged 12 and under. In order to ensure a correct distribution for children by age, it may be better to calculate specific cross-sectional weights for children48. The proposal IS NOT to scale and calculate new weights for children taking into account non- response, household and individual variables, region, children ages…etc. The proposal is to adjust the distribution of children for each year of age. This involves the adjustment of personal cross-sectional weights so as to make the distribution, according to age characteristics, of the children covered in the sample tally with the same information from a more reliable external source (age distribution of children aged 0 to 12 in private households). 𝐷𝑛= children aged n at the day of interview (n=0 to 12)49 Children’s cross-sectional weight for 𝐷𝑛 (n= 0 to 12): 𝑤𝑖= 𝑤′𝑖* 𝑁𝑛/𝑁′𝑛 𝑤′𝑖= personal cross-sectional weight for the child ‘i’ 𝑁′𝑛= sum of personal cross-sectional weights for children aged n at the day of interview in the database 𝑁𝑛= number of children in the demographic population aged n at the 31/12/N-1 (estimated from external source) (Children at the end of income reference period). Notes: The sum of children’s cross-sectional weights will correspond to the estimation of the number of children in the population. The sample size of children will be checked before childcare data are published. (48) This will also enlarge the possibilities for analysis of the detailed data on childcare (estimate total numbers of children cared for, global proportions among all children …). (49) Note for 0 year old: this includes children born in year N-1. Children born in year N are excluded (aged (-1) at the 31/12/N-1; difficult to take them into account to ensure comparable data between countries because of differences in the dates of the surveys in year N). 0+ (format 2.5)    Weight 1 Filled -2 Not applicable (person aged more than 12 years old at the date of interview) -7 Not applicable (RB010 ≠ last year of operation)"
PB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"Year in which the survey data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
PB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,"PB020 together with PB010 and PB030 are key variables and it is important to match different parts of the data. The country of residence is the country in which the person/household has their usual residence. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The SCL GEO is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CL_G EO&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC. Information on the country of residence should be obtained in accordance with the current national boundaries. To the extent to which all possible participants in a specific social micro data-collection need to be usual residents, the country of residence of all the reporting units should correspond with the reporting country. Therefore, a reference question is not needed for this variable. Together with the year and ID, the country code is an important variable used to merge different files."
PB030,PERSONAL ID,"Personal ID (maximum eleven digits) = Household ID (maximum nine digits) + personal number (two digits) Personal number: for every new person in the household add 1 to the highest-used personal number (for all the years of the survey and the Household ID). It refers to the number assigned in ‘the household register’ to the person the first time that he/she is recorded as a household member. It should correspond to the person’s line position in ‘the household register’. Household ID and Personal ID never change, not even when the person moves to another household. Household number ranges from 1 to 9999999 (maximum seven digits) Household ID = Household number + split number (two digits) The split number for the first wave will always take value ‘00’. In the case of the household remaining entire, it keeps the household number and split number from one wave to the next. In the case of a split, the initial household will keep the household number and split number from one wave to the next. The other households, i.e. the split households will keep the same household number, but will be assigned the next available unique split number in sequence. In the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at a previous address, it must retain the household number and split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave. If the new household is at a new address, the household number and split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ will be retained."

Such information must also be treated in the same way, and it is proposed to treat them as married and to classify them under code 2 when the partnership still exists. Otherwise, code 3-5 should be used (legal separation or death of one of the partners and so on). 1 2 3 4 5 Never married Married Separated Widowed Divorced"

PB205,PARTNERS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD,"The variable is a core social variable. The variable describes whether an individual is living with a partner. The categories for the variable describe whether a person is living with a partner in the same household. A ‘partner’ can be defined according to the legal (husband or wife or civil partner) or de facto (partner or cohabitee) relationship status. The variable ‘partners living in the same household’ can be derived from the household grid. Based on his or her partnership/relationship status – legal or de facto – a person is considered to be living with a partner when sharing the same usual residence. In other words, a person who has a partner living in a different household (persons living apart together) should be classified as ‘person not living with a legal or de facto partner’. Accordingly, one-person households are also classified as ‘person not living with a legal or de facto partner’. A person is considered to be a member of the household when having his or her usual residence (see appendix) in the household. In the cases when a separate question is used to get the information on whether a person is living or not with a (legal or de facto) partner, the recommended question is the following: “Are you living with a partner in the same household?” The wording of the question may be adapted so that the different cases of partner relationships – legal (husband/wife/civil partner) or de facto (partner/cohabitee) – can be covered."
PB230,COUNTRY OF BIRTH OF FATHER,"The variable reports on the country of birth of the person’s father, i.e. the country of usual residence (in its current borders, if the information is available) of the mother of the person’s father at the time of the delivery, or, failing this, the country (in its current borders, if the information is available) in which the birth of the person’s father took place. ‘Father’ is a male parent of a ‘son or daughter’, either natural (biological), adoptive or stepfather. Information on the country of birth of the father determines whether the person’s father is native-born (born in the reporting country) or foreign-born (born in a country other than the reporting country). Information on the country of birth of the father should be obtained according to the same rules for the variable ‘country of birth’. ‘Father’ is a male parent of a ‘son/daughter’, either natural (biological), adoptive or stepfather. For a person who has both a natural (biological) father and an adoptive or stepfather, the country of birth should refer to who actually raised the person and acted as father in an affective or legal sense, e.g. the male guardian. For a person with same-sex parents, both being female, this variable could be used to report the country of birth of one of the mothers. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The short list of country codes corresponds to Ramon (GEO) classification as defined in the annex of the guidelines for standardised variables and is included in Annex 10. The flag ‘-1’ should be used for statistical units that are part of the population but for which information is not collected (e.g. persons below a certain age), or  when no information could be given (e.g. no information available). For a person with same-sex parents, both being male, this variable could be used to report the country of birth of one of the fathers. Suggested question:"
PB240,COUNTRY OF BIRTH OF MOTHER,"The variable reports on the country of birth of the person's mother, i.e. the country of usual residence (in its current borders, if the information is available) of the maternal grandmother of the person at the time of the delivery, or, failing that, the country (in its current borders, if the information is available) where the birth of the person's mother took place. 'Mother' is a female parent of a 'son or daughter', either natural (biological), adoptive or stepmother. Information on the country of birth of the mother shows whether the person's mother is native-born (born in the reporting country) or foreign-born (born in a country other than the reporting country). The variable reports on the country of birth of the person's mother, i.e., the country of usual residence (in its current borders, if the information is available) of the maternal grandmother of the person at the time of her delivery, or, failing that, the country (in its current borders, if the information is available) where the birth of the person's mother took place. Information on the country of birth of the mother should be obtained under the same rules as the variable 'country of birth'. 'Mother' is a female parent of a 'son/daughter', either natural (biological), adoptive or stepmother. For a person having both a natural (biological) mother and an adoptive or stepmother, the country of birth should refer to who actually raised the person and acted as mother in an affective or legal sense, e.g., the female guardian. For a person with same-sex parents, both being male, this variable could be used to report the country of birth of one of the fathers.

PB260,NATURE OF PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY,"The variable reports on whether the information requested has been provided by the designated respondent (i.e., direct participation), or via another person (proxy respondent, i.e., indirect participation). A situation where the designated respondent is unable to provide the requested information by him/herself (e.g., due the illness, disability, or language barrier) but is able to do so with assistance of another person and to validate the answers provided, is considered as direct participation. A situation where the designated respondent is unable to provide the requested information (e.g., due the illness or disability) or not ready available (i.e. not available during the enumeration period) and has not validated the answers provided by the proxy respondent (i.e. proxy answers), is considered as an indirect participation (or indirect interview)."

PB270,INTERVIEWING MODE USED (PERSON),"The main interviewing mode used for the individual questionnaire should be recorded. When part of the data is collected from registers, and EU-SILC is collected using CAPI questionnaire then the second option ‘2’ should be recorded. The mode used for a household could be different from the mode used for individuals. Also, the members of the same household can be interviewed using different interview modes. The category concepts describe the interviewing mode used to collect information from the respondent, whether PAPI, CAPI, CATI, CAWI, or other. For PAPI, CAPI and CATI an interviewer is present. CAWI is self-administered and the respondent follows a script provided on a website. The category 'other' should be chosen when the interviewing mode used is not covered by the other variable categories, e.g. paper assisted self-administered interview (PASI), or non-web-based computer assisted self- administered interview (CASI). The category 'not applicable' should be used to count statistical units that are part of the population of the data source but for which it systematically does not report any information on the variable (e.g. persons below a certain age). It can also be used if all the information has been obtained from registers (i.e. administrative data) and/or imputed, and no interview has taken place. In addition, different interviewing modes can be combined (i.e. mixed-mode interview). In such cases, the interviewing mode most used should be reported. For example, in a situation where a person has been first contacted by phone and some data (main part) has been collected via computer assisted web-interview (CAWI) but the missing data (remaining part) is collected at a later stage via computer assisted personal interview (CAPI), the variable should report on CAWI as the interviewing mode used. Specific rules on quality reporting may be provided for each micro-data collection. In cases where administrative and survey data and/or different interviewing modes are combined, you should keep the information on the data collection mode and on the interviewing mode used at the variable level."
PE010,PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL EDUCATION AND,"From 2021 onwards the variable name was changed to a standardised variable. The flags are the same as all other non-income variables. From 2014 onwards The question is whether the person is currently participating in formal educational. An educational programme, as defined under ISCED-2011, is “A coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed and organised to achieve pre-determined learning objectives or accomplish a specific set of educational tasks over a sustained period” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2012, p. 8). Participation in this programme may be on a full-time attendance basis, a part-time attendance basis or by correspondence course. This variable only covers the formal education system (including schools, colleges and universities) that corresponds to the programmes covered by the questionnaires used in the UOE data collection (administrative data collection, common for UNESCO, OECD and Eurostat). Formal education is defined in ISCED 2011 as “education that is institutionalised, intentional and planned through public organizations and recognised private bodies, and – in their totality – constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education programmes are thus recognised as such by the relevant national education or equivalent authorities, e.g., any other institution in cooperation with the national or sub- national education authorities. Formal education consists mostly of initial education. Vocational education, special needs education and some parts of adult education are often recognised as being part of the formal education system. If the interviewee is enrolled as a student or an apprentice in a programme within the formal education system the answer will be 1. This includes modules (short programmes/courses) which may be part of a longer regular education programme that are taken and completed, providing graduates with the corresponding academic credit, independent of whether the person continues to complete the full programme or not. The level of short programmes/courses will be the same as the programme of which they form part. For apprentices who are in a period of 'on-the-job training' or alternate ‘on-the-job’ and ‘in-school learning’ within the framework of an alternate (e.g., dual) programme, the answer is code 1, since the person is enrolled"
PE021,LEVEL OF CURRENT/MOST RECENT FORMAL,
PE041,EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT LEVEL,
PH010,SELF-PERCEIVED GENERAL HEALTH,"This variable is part of standardised variables and also part of the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM. The MEHM consists of two more variables on health status: long-standing health problem and limitation in activities because of health problems (also known as Global Activity Limitation Indicator - GALI). If the MEHM is implemented, all the questions should be asked in the recommended order (i.e. self-perceived general health, long-standing health problem, and limitation in activities because of health problems) and with no inclusion of any other health status related questions before or between the MEHM questions as it could have an impact on the results. During the interview, all answer options should systematically be read out to respondents. The concept of self-perceived health is subjective. The notion is restricted to an assessment coming from the individual and as far as possible not from anyone else, whether an interviewer, healthcare professional or relative. Self-perceived health might be influenced by impressions or opinions from others but is the result after these impressions have been processed by the individual relative to his/her own beliefs and attitudes. The reference is to health in general rather than the present state of health, as the question is not intended to measure temporary health problems. The different dimensions of health should be included, i.e., physical and emotional functioning, mental health (covering psychological well-being and mental disorders) and biomedical signs and symptoms. It omits any reference to age as respondents are not specifically asked to compare their health with others of the same age or with their own previous or future health state. Five options for answers are proposed. Two (‘very good’ and ‘good’) are at the upper end of the scale and two (‘bad’ and ‘very bad’) are at the lower. It is also important to note that the intermediate category ‘fair’ should be translated into an appropriately neutral term (i.e., neither good nor bad), as far as possible keeping in mind cultural interpretations, in the various languages (50). For this question a proxy should be avoided and used only as an exception. (50) As a reference for translating answer categories for PH010 model question official translations of Commission Regulation (EU) No 141/2013 of 19 February 2013 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work, as regards statistics based on the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) (Annex I) can be used: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32013R0141:EN:NOT"
PH020,SUFFER FROM ANY CHRONIC [LONG-STANDING],"The question corresponding to this variable is part of standardised variables and also part of the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM). It should be asked just after the PH010 question and just before the PH030 question. It should not be used as a filter question for the PH030 variable. The MEHM consists of two more variables on health status: self-perceived general health and limitation in activities because of health problems (also known as Global Activity Limitation Indicator - GALI). If the MEHM is implemented, all the questions should be asked in the recommended order (i.e. self-perceived general health, long-standing health problem, and limitation in activities because of health problems) and with no inclusion of any other health status related questions before or between the MEHM questions as it could have an impact on the results. On implementing the reference question (see section 'reference question'), it is necessary to keep in mind that the recommended wording allows for possible adaptations. For instance: • ‘chronic’ or ‘long-standing’ should be chosen according to what is ‘best understood’ in a country/language. • it is intended to ask if people ‘have’ a chronic condition, not if they really 'suffer' from it. However, the verb 'suffer' can be used in countries/languages where it is considered more suitable for the question formulation and still retains the same meaning as the verb 'have' in English. • ‘health problem’ seems not to be understood in some countries/languages and therefore ‘illness or condition’ is the alternative. The terms ‘disability, handicap, impairment’ should not be included in the question as synonyms for ‘illness or health problem’. Rather than adding further details to the question wording, interviewees should be instructed to be as inclusive as possible when considering the actual prevalence of a long-standing health problem. This means that the following could be considered as long-standing health problems (i.e., the corresponding option for an answer would be 'yes'): • problems that are seasonal or intermittent, even where they ‘flare up’ for less than six months at a time (for instance allergies); • chronic problems not considered by the respondent as very serious; severity doesn't play a role in this variable; • problems that have not been diagnosed by a doctor (to exclude these would mean permitting those with better access to medical services to declare more problems); • a long-standing disease that doesn't bother the respondent and/or is kept under control with medication (for instance people with a high blood pressure);"
PH030,LIMITATION IN ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF HEALTH,"The model question is part of standardised variables and part of the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM). It should be asked just after the PH020 question and should not be filtered by the PH020 question. The MEHM consists of two more variables on health status: self-perceived general health and long-standing health problem. If the MEHM is implemented, all the questions should be asked in the recommended order (i.e. self-perceived general health, long-standing health problem, and limitation in activities because of health problems) and with no inclusion of any other health status related questions before or between the MEHM questions as it could have impact on results. The question should clearly show that the reference is to the activities people usually do and not to respondent’s ‘own activities’. Neither a list with examples of activities (for example work or school, home or leisure activities) nor a reference to the age group of the subject is included in the question. As such it gives no restrictions by culture, age, gender or the subjects own ambition. Specification of health concepts (e.g., physical and mental health) should be avoided. The purpose of the instrument is to measure the presence of long-standing limitations, as the consequences of such long-standing limitations (e.g., care, dependency) are more serious. The variable reports on participation restriction through long-standing limitation (6 months or more) in activities that people usually do because of health problems, and its severity. It measures the respondent’s self-assessment of whether he/she is limited (in ‘activities people usually do’) by any on-going physical, mental or emotional health problem, including disease or impairment, and old age. Consequences of injuries/accidents, congenital conditions, etc., are all included. Only the limitations directly caused by or related to one or more health problems are considered. Limitations due to financial, cultural or other none health-related causes should not be taken into account. The everyday activities should be considered, while their abilities to do certain sports should not be included as limitation. An activity is defined as: ‘the performance of a task or action by an individual’ and thus activity limitations are defined as ‘the difficulties the individual experiences in performing an activity'. People with long-standing limitations due to health problems have passed through a process of adaptation which may have resulted in a reduction of their activities. To be able to identify existing limitations a reference is necessary and therefore the activity limitations are assessed against a generally accepted population standard, relative to cultural and"
PH040,UNMET NEED FOR MEDICAL EXAMINATION OR,"From 2015 onwards The purpose of the variable is to capture the restricted access to medical care according to the person’s own assessment of whether he or she needed medical examination or treatment, but did not get it, experienced a delay in getting it or did not seek for it. Delay in getting healthcare can be treated as unmet need if considered by respondents as important. However, detailing the time between the need for the service and the time of having the service is not possible as for different health conditions/problems different time references would be needed. It is up to respondents to consider if the delay was too long and if they consider it as unmet need. Medical care refers to individual healthcare services (medical examination or treatment) provided by or under direct supervision of medical doctors (ISCO-08 code 221 group on general and specialist medical practitioners), traditional and complementary medical professionals (ISCO-08 code 2230) or equivalent professions according to national healthcare systems. Included: • Medical mental healthcare; • Prevention if perceived by respondents as important. For example, a national healthcare system guarantees regular preventive medical check-ups but the respondent is not able to make an appointment and perceives the situation as jeopardizing his/her health. Healthcare provided for different purposes (curative, rehabilitative, long-term healthcare) and by different modes of provision (inpatient, outpatient, day, and home care) Excluded: • Self-medication (taking prescribed or non-prescribed drugs). • Dental care."
PH050,MAIN REASON FOR UNMET NEED FOR MEDICAL,"From 2015 onwards The purpose of this variable is to collect the main reason for unmet need for medical examination or treatment based on personal assessment. This is follow-up variable to the PH040 Unmet need for medical examination or treatment. The purpose of the variable is to capture the reasons for a restricted access to medical care according to the person’s own. Included: • Medical mental healthcare. • Prevention if perceived by respondents as important. For example, a national healthcare system guaranties regular preventive medical check-ups but the respondent is not able to make an appointment and perceives the situation as jeopardising his/her health. • Care provided for different purposes (curative, rehabilitative, long-term healthcare) and by different modes of provision (inpatient, outpatient, day, and home care). Excluded: • Self-medication (taking prescribed or non-prescribed drugs). • Dental care. It is recommended that the question is implemented in the following way: PH040_Q1: Was there any time during the last 12 months when you really needed a medical examination or treatment (excluding dental) for yourself?"
PH060,UNMET NEED FOR DENTAL EXAMINATION OR,"From 2015 onwards The aim of the variable is to capture unmet needs for dental care according to the person’s own assessment of whether he or she needed dental examination or treatment, but didn't get it, experienced a delay in getting it or didn't seek for it. Delay in getting care can be treated as unmet need if considered by respondents as important. It is up to respondents to consider if the delay was too long and if they consider it as unmet need. Dental care refers to individual healthcare services provided by or under direct supervision of stomatologists (dentists) (ISCO-08 code 2261). Healthcare provided by orthodontists is included. Included: • Prevention if perceived by respondents as important. For example, a national healthcare system guarantees regular preventive medical check-ups but the respondent is not able to make an appointment and perceives the situation as jeopardising his/her health. Excluded: • Self-medication (taking prescribed or non-prescribed drugs). • Medical care. It is recommended that the question is implemented in the following way: PH060_Q1: Was there any time during the last 12 months when you really needed a dental examination or treatment for yourself? Yes (I really needed at least at one occasion dental examination or treatment )  1 No (I did not need any dental examination or treatment)  2 FILTER: If PH060_Q1 = 1 then GO TO PH060_Q2. Else GO TO [next module]. PH060_Q2: Did you have a dental examination or treatment each time you really needed? Yes (I had a dental examination or treatment each time I needed)  1 No (there was at least one occasion when I did not have a dental examination or treatment)  2 FILTER: If PH060_Q2 = 2 then GO TO PH070_Q1. Else GO TO [next module]. Recommendations on the model question(s):"
PH070,MAIN REASON FOR UNMET NEED FOR DENTAL,"From 2015 onwards This variable aims to capture the main reason for unmet need for dental examination or treatment. It is recommended that the question is implemented in the following way: PH070_Q1: What was the main reason for not having a dental examination or treatment? Could not afford to (too expensive)  1 Waiting list  2 Could not take time because of work, care for children or for others  3 Too far to travel or no means of transportation  4 Fear of dentists, hospitals, examination or treatment  5 Wanted to wait and see if problem got better on its own  6 Did not know any good dentist  7 Other reasons  8 Recommendations on the model question(s): • To follow the proposed order of the answer options. • All the answer options should be read out during the interview (to be sure that the main reason is answered based on all possible options). Explanations for the reasons of unmet needs: • Could not afford to (too expensive)."
PD020,REPLACE WORN-OUT CLOTHES BY SOME NEW,"The focus is on the replacement of the worn-out clothes by some new clothes e.g., suits, winter coats, pants. It is important to note that the variable refers to worn-out clothes, and not old-fashioned ones. Suggested question: Could you tell me if you can replace worn-out clothes by some new (not second-hand) ones? Please mark. 1    Yes 2    No, cannot afford 3    No, other reasons"
PD030,TWO PAIRS OF PROPERLY FITTING SHOES,"The concept of shoes has to be understood in a broad sense and adapted to the climatic conditions of the countries concerned (including both boots and sandals). On the other hand, all-weather shoes (excluding sandals and boots) could be defined as any daily life shoes. Daily life shoes should be shoes the respondent can wear most days e.g., to work. Suggested question: Do you have two pairs of shoes in a good condition that are suitable for daily activities? (Note: Two pairs of properly fitting shoes, suitable for daily activities including a pair of all-weather shoes) Please mark. 1    Yes 2    No, cannot afford 3    No, other reasons"
PD050,GET-TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS/FAMILY,"Friends should be understood as people the respondent enjoys being with and with whom the respondent shares private matters. The family, or relatives, should be understood in its widest meaning. It includes father/mother/children, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, families-in-law, etc. To get together for a drink/meal: To get-together for a drink/meal means spending time eating and/or drinking with friends or family (relatives) at home or elsewhere (restaurant, pub, etc.). Getting together with friends for professional matters only is excluded. The ‘No - cannot afford it’ answer for getting together for a drink/meal refers to the financial exclusion/ deprivation. The ‘No - other reason’ answer for this variable refers to another type of exclusion, namely the social exclusion. This formulation is thought to be more adapted in a cross-national perspective because having friends at home is not the main way to have social relation in all countries. This variable aims to take into account the multi-cultural specificities as well as the financial and social aspects of deprivation. Suggested question: Do you get-together with friends/family (relatives) for a drink/meal at least once a month?"
PD060,REGULARLY PARTICIPATE IN A LEISURE,"Regularly: The term ‘regularly’ is linked to the repeated activity (ies) and is to be self-defined by the respondent. However, a ‘yes’ answer should imply that leisure activities (all together) are done several times per year. Leisure activity: Activities such as sport, cinema, concert, etc. should occur outside the home. These activities would incur costs for entrance and/or travel costs (e.g., swimming), for purchase costs (e.g., riding a bicycle) or for participating in organised events (e.g. football club fees). The formal organisation of activities is not an important element. Suggested question: Do you regularly participate in a leisure activity (that costs money) outside home?"
PD070,SPEND A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY EACH,"To spend a small amount of money on yourself means to freely spend money, to buy/do something for yourself, for your own pleasure e.g., to go to the movies, to buy a small object, to buy a magazine, a small book, a cake, an ice-cream in summer or other small things to eat, to go to the hairdresser, etc. The ""Yes"" answer means that the person can afford to spend this money. Suggested question: ‘Do you spend a small amount of money most weeks on yourself, for your own pleasure (buying/doing something for yourself)?’"
PD080,INTERNET CONNECTION FOR PERSONAL USE AT,"Internet access can be via Smartphone (e.g., BlackBerry/iPhone), other wireless handheld device (tablet, etc …), video games console, laptop, desktop computer, TV etc. Examples of internet activities for personal use: social networking, sending/receiving emails, using services related to travel and accommodation, creating web pages, blogs, internet banking, reading or downloading online music, video, news etc., looking for information, telephoning or making video calls, buying/selling goods or services, taking part in online consultations or voting on civil or political issues etc. The household member is considered to have an internet connection for personal use at home only if all the needs for personal use are fully fulfilled by this connection. Suggested question: ‘Do you have an Internet connection at home for personal use when needed?’"
PW010,OVERALL LIFE SATISFACTION,"Life satisfaction represents a report of how a respondent evaluates or appraises his or her life taken as a whole. The term ‘life’ is intended here as all areas of a person’s life at a particular point in time (these days). The variable focuses on how people are feeling ‘these days’ rather than specifying a longer or shorter time period. The intent is not to obtain the emotional state of the respondent at the given moment but for them to make a reflective judgement on their level of satisfaction. Registers are not applicable and are not supposed to be used for wellbeing questions. Moreover, unit should include all current household members aged 16 years and over or selected respondent (where applicable). The notion is restricted to an assessment coming from the individual and as far as possible not from anyone else. The suggested question is: Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days? Please answer (circle) on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means not at all satisfied and 10 means completely satisfied. Not at all satisfied 0-----1-----2------3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----9-----10 Completely satisfied"
PW191,TRUST IN OTHERS,"The variable refers to the respondent’s opinion/feeling. 'Social trust is […] a core value or belief; an abstract evaluation of the moral standards of the society in which we live' (Sturgis et al. 2012). Others should be treated as people with whom the respondent is not acquainted (family, friends, neighbours etc. should be excluded). It should mean that ""most people"" can be trusted, but (as reported by interviewers) 10 is chosen when ""all people can be trusted"". If there is no response or a refusal to respond, the value of the variable will be missing, and the record flag should be filled as ‘-1’. Registers are not applicable and are not supposed to be used on wellbeing questions. Moreover, unit should include all current household members aged 16 years and over or selected respondent (where applicable). The notion is restricted to an assessment coming from the individual and as far as possible not from anyone else. Suggested question: ‘Would you say that most people can be trusted?’ ‘To what extent do you trust other people?’ Please answer (circle) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means that in general you do not trust any other person and 10 that you feel most people can be trusted. Do not trust at all 0-----1-----2------3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----9-----10 Trust completely (with the order 0 to 10 and not 10 to 0)"
PL016,EXISTENCE OF PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT,"This variable is part of the standardised social variable list. The variable provides information on whether a person without employment has previously been in employment, and whether the previous employment experience was or not limited to purely occasional work. For the purpose of this variable, occasional work refers to a job without the features of continuity and job security. It is defined as a job that lasted less than three months (regardless of whether the job is part-time or full-time, formal or informal) and had only one spell in time. Employment is defined in the 19th ICLS resolution53 concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization. The previous employment experience should be employment for pay or profit, with at least one hour of work per week. A person who only has work experience that is not in line with the employment definition in the 19th ICLS resolution (eg. unpaid work or unpaid traineeships) should be coded as having no employment experience. Unpaid family work is considered as employment according to the 19th ICLS resolution and should be treated as employment experience. Work as a conscript (compulsory military or civilian service) should not be considered as employment experience for this variable. Seasonal workers working less than three months but for several consecutive years should be considered as having employment experience other than occasional work. By contrast, persons who only have vacation work which lasted less than three months over the course of only one year should be considered as has having employment experience limited to occasional work. 53 See 19th ICLS resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international- conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm"
PL032,SELF-DEFINED CURRENT ECONOMIC STATUS,"From 2021 operation onwards, the variable PL032 replaces PL031 where modalities are changed according to standardised social variables. This variable should only be collected from interviewees and information should not be obtained from registers. The self-declared current ‘main activity status’: the main status refers to the current situation (situation at the moment of the data collection/interview). The concept of ‘current’ implies that any definitive changes in (54) An agreement was reached during the Living Conditions Working Group meeting in June 2008 that the variable PL030 will be replaced by the variable PL031 with slightly different answering categories in order to harmonise labour variables. In 2010, the LC WG agreed that from the 2011 operation onwards, they would suppress PL030 and retain only PL031."
PL060,NUMBER OF HOURS USUALLY WORKED PER,"If the respondent has multiple jobs, the main job is the one in which the most hours are usually worked. Persons who changed job during the reference week should regard the job at the end of the reference week as their main job. The number of hours corresponds to the number of hours the person normally works in their main job. This covers all hours including extra hours, either paid or unpaid, which the person normally works, but excludes the travel time between the home and the place of work as well as the main meal break (normally taken at midday). Persons who usually also work at home are asked to include the number of hours they usually work at home. Some persons, particularly self-employed and family workers, may not have usual hours, in the sense that their hours vary considerably from week to week or month to month. When the respondent is unable to provide the number of usual hours for this reason, the average of the hours actually worked per week over the past four weeks is used as a measure of usual hours. Code ‘-6’ is applied to those cases where neither the number of usual hours, nor an average number of hours worked over the past four weeks, can be established. For self-employed people, , usual hours may also include work done at home, such as planning, record-keeping and so on. In the case of teachers, hours worked should be considered as the hours of teaching, those dedicated to preparation of classes, study, research as well as hours of compulsory attendance in the centre of studies. Apprentices, trainees and other persons in vocational training should exclude the time spent in school or other special training centres. Suggested question: ‘How many hours do you usually work per week in your main job?’ Please note that this question does not include hours worked in your second or third jobs. Please write the number of hours:  _________________"
PL073,NUMBER OF MONTHS SPENT IN FULL-TIME WORK,"This variable is derived from calendar activity status. The condition is full-time job (see PL145). Nevertheless, for the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (the remain individuals 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’. If the person combines different part-time jobs as an employee that result in the equivalent hours of a full-time job, the person should consider themselves as an employee working full-time (modality 1). The same holds if the person has a main job as an employee and an additional ""small"" (in terms of hours) second job as a self-employed person, both jobs being remunerated in what would be considered, together, as the remuneration for a full-time equivalent role. If more than one type of activity occurs in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (“main activity: work”) over non-economic activity or inactivity. If the respondent worked, at least two weeks of the month, then the variables PL073 ‘Number of months spent at full-time work as employee’; should be filled. If more than one activity status applies in the same month, the respondent will select one on the basis of self- assessment. The criteria of most time spent may be useful where applicable. The self-declared ‘main activity status’ is self-assessed by the respondent and the chosen category should appropriately describe how a person mainly perceives themselves. The self-declared main activity status is determined on the basis of how most time is spent, but no criteria have been specified explicitly. Full-time/part-time: the distinction between full-time and part-time work should be made on the basis of a spontaneous answer provided by the respondent in the calendar activity reported. It is impossible to establish a more exact distinction between part-time and full-time work, due to variations in working hours between countries and also between industry sectors. By checking the answer with the number of hours usually worked, it should be possible to detect and even to correct implausible answers, since part-time work will rarely exceed 35 hours, while full-time work will usually start at about 30 hours. Work means any work for pay or profit. Pay includes cash payments or ‘payment in kind’. Self-employed persons with a business, farm or professional practice are also considered to be working if one of the following applies:"
PL074,NUMBER OF MONTHS SPENT IN PART-TIME,"This variable can be derived from the calendar of activity. For the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (other household members aged 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’ (PL032). In particular, if the person combines different part-time jobs as an employee leading to an equivalent full-time work, the person should consider themselves as an employee working full-time. The same holds if the person has a main job as an employee and an additional ""small"" (in terms of hours) second job as a self-employed person, both jobs being remunerated in what would be considered, together, as the remuneration for a full-time equivalent role. If more than one type of activity occurs in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (“main activity: work”) over non-economic activity and over inactivity. On the basis of this principle, the following rules may be used: If the respondent worked part-time, at least two weeks of the month, then variables; PL074 ‘Number of months spent in part-time work as employee’ should be filled. If more than one activity status applies in the same month, the respondent will select one on the basis of self- assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable. The self-declared ‘main activity status’: the variable refers to a person’s own perception of their current main activity status. The different statuses refer to socially relevant categories including labour market participation, but also consider several categories of social status for persons where employment is not the main activity. It does not apply criteria of a specific concept e.g. of labour market participation as defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The main activity status is self-assessed by the respondent and the chosen category should appropriately describe how a person mainly perceives themselves. The self-declared main activity status is determined on the basis of how most time is spent, but no criteria have been specified explicitly.

On the basis of this principle, the following rules may be used: If the respondent worked as self-employed, at least two weeks of the month, then PL075 ‘Number of months spent in full-time work as self-employed (including family worker)’ and/or PL076 ‘Number of months spent in part-time work as self- employed (including family worker’ should be filled in. If more than one of the other situations applies in the same month, the respondent should select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable.

Only part-time and self-employed persons should be considered as PL076. Self-employed means persons who work for their own business, professional practice or farm to earn a profit. Members of producer co-operatives should be considered as self-employed if in the co-operative, each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organisation of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment among their members.

For the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (other household members aged 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’ The target variable captures the person’s own perception of their main activity. It differs from the ILO concept to the extent that people’s own perception of their main status differs from the strict definitions used in the ILO definitions. Respondents can see themselves as being unemployed irrespective of an official status or a registration with the public employment agency. Unemployed can also have “small” jobs while seeking for a main job. Early retirement for economic reasons can be included as unemployed according to the respondent's perception i.e., a person in early retirement for economic reasons will be included as unemployed if they classify themselves as being unemployed.

The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’. The target variable captures the person’s own perception of their main activity. Respondents can consider themselves as retired if they receive a pension or if they have finally stopped working or given up their business because of their age or age related health condition. Still, they could work e.g., in a “small” job. Persons in early retirement that is not connected to health issues can also choose this category. However, early retirement due to economic reasons is classified according to the respondent's feeling, i.e., a person in early retirement for economic reasons will be included here only if they classify themselves as being retired. If early retirement for economic reasons and according to the respondent's perception, they include themselves as unemployed then the early retirement for economic reasons should be included as unemployed if they classify themselves as being unemployed.

Persons can consider themselves unable to work due to long-standing health problems if they are unable to work due to health reasons or disabilities for a longer, undetermined or permanent time and/or are unfit to work. The response is given based on self-assessment and is independent from the benefit they receive. Persons who have not reached retirement age but are unable to work due to health reasons or disabilities for a longer or undetermined time can choose based on self-assessment, the category unable to work due to long-standing health problems. Persons who are in early retirement due to health reasons can choose this category based on self-assessment if they would not rather consider themselves as retired.

For the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (other household members aged 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’. Persons being part of military service during the income reference period should record the number of months. If a person has not reached the age of being involved in the military service, the value is ‘0’ and likewise if a person has reached the age when the military service is no longer applicable. If more than one of the other situations applies in the same month, the respondent should select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable. If more than one type of activity occurs in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (“main activity: work”) over non-economic activity and over inactivity. Note: The total number of months recorded for the respondent in PL073+ PL074+ PL075+ PL076+ PL080+ PL085+ PL086+ PL087+ PL087+PL089+ PL090 cannot exceed 12."
PL089,NUMBER OF MONTHS SPENT FULFILLING,"This variable can be derived from the calendar of activity. For the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (other household members aged 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’ (PL032). The target variable captures the person’s own perception of their main activity. It differs from the ILO concept to the extent that people’s own perception of their main status differs from the strict definitions used in the ILO definitions. If more than one of the other situations applies in the same month, the respondent should select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable. If more than one type of activity occurs in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (“main activity: work”) over non-economic activity and over inactivity. If more than one of the other situations apply in the same month, the respondent should select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable. The category 'fulfilling domestic tasks' includes all activities needed to run a private household including the raising of children.

PL090,NUMBER OF MONTHS SPENT IN OTHER,"This variable can be derived from the calendar of activity. For the selected respondent countries, or when this is not possible, part of the information can be derived (selected respondent 16+) and part of it can be asked through interview (other household members aged 16+). The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’ (PL032). Persons who cannot choose one of the activity status categories can select the category 'other'. These can be volunteers or mainly inactive persons. Also, these persons could have a job or fulfil domestic tasks. If more than one of the other situations applies in the same month, the respondent should select one on the basis of self-assessment. The criterion of most time spent may be useful where applicable. If more than one type of activity occurs in the same month, priority should be given to economic activity (“main activity: work”) over non-economic activity and over inactivity.

PL100,TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS PER WEEK USUALLY,"If multiple jobs are held, the number of hours usually worked in the second, third (and more) jobs should be recorded. For the number of hours usually worked per week in the main job, see PL060. Suggested question: ‘How many hours do you usually work per week in your second and third (and subsequent) jobs?’ Please note that this question includes hours of work in your second, third jobs if you have one beside your main one. This covers all hours including extra hours, either paid or unpaid, which you normally work, but it excludes the travel time between the home and the place of work as well as the main meal break (normally taken at midday)."
PL141,PERMANENCY OF MAIN JOB,"The variable is part of the standardised variables. The variable refers to the current job if PL040A=3 “Employee”. This question is addressed only to employees. The variable distinguishes whether the contract of the main job has a limited duration (i.e., the job will terminate after a predefined period), or is a permanent contract without a fixed end. The variable refers to the main job. What counts is the contractual (or the informal or verbal arrangement) arrangement of the employment relationship, and not the expectation that the respondent might have to lose the job, their plan to leave it, their wish to stay or the probability to stay there permanently. Persons may have one or several jobs. For employees, each contract can be considered as a separate set of tasks and duties, and consequently as a separate job. In cases of holding multiple jobs, the main job is the one with the longest hours usually worked, as defined in the international statistical standards on working time. A job with a fixed-term contract or agreement that will terminate either after a period of time determined in advance (by a known date), or after a period not known in advance, but nevertheless defined by objective criteria, such as the completion of an assignment or the period of absence of an employee temporarily replaced. A job with a contract or agreement that has no such predefined end is counted as permanent."
PL145,FULL OR PART-TIME MAIN JOB (SELF-DEFINED),"The variable is one of the standardised variables. The variable describes the usual time-involvement in the main job of a person in employment, based on the person's own perception (i.e., self-defined) of the usual hours worked in the main job. If the respondent has several jobs, the main job is the one where the respondent usually works the most hours. The variable refers to the main job of a person in employment. This main job can be a full-time job or a part- time job. The distinction should be based on the respondent's own perception referring to the usual hours worked in the main job. The distinction between a full-time and part-time job should be made on the basis of the self-assessment given by the respondent. If this answer does not come spontaneously from the respondent, the following guidance can be given: A person in a part-time job works less than a comparable full-time worker having a job in the same occupation and in the same local unit. For persons who cannot compare working hours because they are working alone, the benchmark is the group of people who work in the same occupation and the same industry sector. A long reference period means at least four weeks and ideally three months. Weeks with absences due to holidays, leaves or strikes should not be taken into account. In case of very irregular working hours or a job that has just been started, an average regarding the last four weeks or contractual hours can be used as a proxy. Working hours include (1) the time spent at the workplace, meaning the place where work tasks and duties are normally carried out, and (2) the time used for carrying out work tasks outside the workplace even if they are not directly paid. This includes the work of teachers outside the classroom. Only the hours of the main job are counted. On-call time is only counted if it is spent at the workplace or implies high restrictions on the person in employment. The main meal break is not counted as working time even if spent at the workplace. Travelling time for business trips is counted but not commuting time. Training time is counted as working time if it is"
PL150,SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MAIN JOB,"The variable is one of the standardised variables. Supervisory responsibility includes the formal responsibility for supervising a group of other employees (other than apprentices and trainees), whom the respondent supervises directly, sometimes when doing some of the work that he or she supervises. It implies that the supervisor or foreman takes charge of the work, directs the work and sees that it is properly conducted.  A person is considered to have supervisory responsibilities when they formally supervise the work of at least one (other) person. Corresponding responsibilities toward apprentices and trainees do not count as supervision. Neither does mere quality control (check output of services but not the work produced by other persons) or consultancy. The variable refers to the main job of a person in employment who is an employee. The usual situation should be considered (and not the situation during the reference period only). Persons having supervisory responsibilities only because they are temporarily replacing an absent superior should not be considered as having supervisory responsibilities. The definition 'temporarily' here is left to the respondent. In some cases, the person is combining supervising responsibilities with other functions. Even if the supervising responsibilities only constitute a part of their job, they should be considered as employees with supervisory responsibilities (answering category 'yes'). Members of groups with collective responsibility (groups where there is a rotating leadership in a continuous way taking charge of the work of other employees, directing their work and seeing that is satisfactorily carried out) should be considered as having supervisory responsibilities. Suggested question: ‘Do you supervise the work of other employees in your main job?’ Yes, No"
PL200,NUMBER OF YEARS SPENT IN PAID WORK [AS,"The variable provides a summary measure of the labour force experience of the person. This covers the number of years since the respondent started their first regular job, that they have spent at work, whether as an employee or self-employed. When a person had a job, but was temporarily absent because of maternity leave, injury or temporary disability, slack work for technical or economic reasons, the related period is to be taken into account when computing the number of years spent in paid work. At work: is self-defined. In cases where there is doubt, such as when the person spent a number of years working on a part-time basis, the person’s own perception of whether their main activity was ‘at work’ or something else should be taken. If a person retires and continues to have a paid work at the same time, this time period should only be taken into account if the person declares themselves as working. If this person considers themselves as retired, then the number of years spent in paid work stops with the retirement of the person. Vacation jobs taken by students, from which they return to studies or to other non-work situations are not taken into account, as well as any other casual job undertaken from time to time. Part-time jobs that the person may have engaged in while still in school or university are not included. However, if the person works or worked in formal regular work, during their studies, this work should be considered. Suggested question: ‘How many years did you spend in a regular paid job excluding periods of inactivity (unemployment, training…..)?’ (When temporarily absent from a job because of maternity leave, injury or temporary disability, slack work for technical or economic reasons, ... the related period is to be taken into account when computing the number of years spent in paid work). Please write the number of years:________  _________________"
PL271,DURATION OF THE MOST RECENT,"The variable should capture the duration of respondent’s most recent unemployment spell during the last 5 years from the date of the interview. This variable should be collected during the first interview with the respondent but should be transmitted to Eurostat annually. The information for the next years can be obtained from registers or imputed based on other variables, however when not possible the variable should be collected from respondents directly also in following years. The Unit to whom this information should be collected from refers to all current household members aged 16 years and over or selected respondent (where applicable) of working age. For the purpose of this variable the working age population includes persons aged 16-74. The age of the person refers to the age at the end of income reference period. Age should be defined as RB081. This variable is helpful for Euromod as it is crucial for the correct modelling of unemployment benefit eligibility and entitlement conditions by identifying the duration of the most recent unemployment spell. The status is self-defined, and the same definitions apply as for the variable ‘self-defined current economic status’. Respondents can see themselves as being unemployed irrespective of an official status or a registration with the public employment agency. It differs from the ILO concept to the extent that people’s own perception of their main status differs from the strict definitions used in the ILO definitions. If the person is currently unemployed, then the most recent unemployment spell refers to the current one. The Flag ‘-8’ is used when the variable is not collected in the respective year and the flag ‘-7’ if year <2021. Suggested question: PL271_Q1: ‘Have you been unemployed during last 60 months?’"
PL230,PUBLIC/PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR,"The public employment sector comprises the general government sector plus all public corporations, including the central bank. The private sector comprises private corporations, households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs). For the mixed public-private sector, the category chosen should be ‘3 Mixed'. Persons engaged by an employment agency or business and hired out to a third party to carry out a work trip (unless there is a work contract of unlimited duration with the employment agency or business) are to be considered as private sector. This follows the OECD criterion, which defines the sector according to the employer’s identity. For more information, see the OECD glossary67. Suggested question: FILTER: If PL032 = 1, go to PL230_Q1; If PL032 not in (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) >> go to the next question. PL230_Q1: Do you work in the public or private sector? 1. Public sector 2. Private sector 3. Mixed 99. Don’t know 67http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2130 & http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2199"
PW100,JOB SATISFACTION,"The variable refers to the respondent’s opinion and feelings about the degree of satisfaction with their job. The respondent should make a broad, reflective appraisal of all areas of their job at a particular point in time (their current situation). While making this evaluation, the respondent should take into consideration the tasks performed, workplace atmosphere, pay and hours, etc. The activity status is based on the person's own perception of their main activity. This is, in principle, determined on the basis of the greatest amount of time spent, but no criteria have been specified. If the respondent has several jobs, they should refer to the main job. If the respondent works and studies at the same time, they should refer to the current job if they declared the job as their current economic activity in variable PL032. Otherwise, flag ‘-2’ should be used. Suggested question: FILTER: If PL032 = 1, go to PW100_Q1; If PL032 not in (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) >> go to the next question. PW100_Q1: Overall, how satisfied are you with your job? [Consider your main job only] Please answer on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means not at all satisfied and 10 means completely satisfied. From 0 (Not at all satisfied) to 10 (Completely satisfied) Not applicable Don't know Not selected respondent PW100 Your present job 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -2 (PL032 ≠ 1) 99 flag = -3"
PL260,USUAL HOURS WORKED PER WEEK,"This variable indicates the number of hours usually worked per week in the main, second, third (and subsequent) job during the income reference period. It covers all hours including overtime, whether paid or unpaid, which the person usually worked, but excludes the travel time between home and the place of work as well as the main meal breaks (usually taken at midday). This variable is similar to PL060 and PL100 as regards its coverage, however a different reference period is used. While PL060 and PL100 refer to ‘current period’, PL260 refers to ‘income reference period’. Persons who were not working, but had a job or business from which they were absent during part of the reference period, should report the amount of hours per week usually worked in reference to the period that they were working. Persons who changed job during the reference period should consider the job that describes best the number of hours usually worked per week during the entire reference period. This means that if a person has worked for 8 months as a part-time employee and 4 months as a full-time employee (within the reference period), the amount of hours usually worked per week as a part-time employee should be the one reported. Persons who were not working, but had a job or business from which they were absent during the entire reference period, should report ‘0’ for the number of hours. Persons who were unemployed during part of the reference period, should report the amount of hours per week usually worked in reference to the period that they were employed. This means that if a person was employed for 6 months and unemployed for 6 months (within the reference period), the amount of hours usually worked per week as an employee should be the one reported. Persons who usually worked at home (within the definitions given below) are asked to include the number of hours they usually worked at home. Hours spent on work-related training for professionals should be considered. Apprentices, trainees and other persons in vocational training are asked to exclude the time spent in school or other special training centres."
PL130,SIZE OF THE LOCAL UNIT FOR MAIN JOB,"This variable refers to the main job. If multiple jobs are held or were held, the main job should be considered as the one in which the greatest number of hours are usually worked. The person themselves should be included in the total number, as should the employer. For the definition of ‘local unit’ see PL100: Total number of hours usually worked in second, third jobs etc., and Annex 5: The enterprise and local unit. Suggested question: FILTER: If PL032 = 1, go to PL130_Q1; If PL032 not in (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) >> go to the next question. PL130_Q1: How many employees are working in the local unit where you are working (including yourself)? _______(1-9) 10 11 12 13 14 15 Exact number of persons, if between 1 and 9 10 to 19 persons 20 to 49 persons 50 to 249 persons 250 persons or more Do not know but less than 10 persons Do not know, but 10 persons or more"
PL035,WORKED AT LEAST ONE HOUR DURING THE,"A person is considered as working if they did any work for pay or profit during the reference week or if they were not working but had a job or business from which they were absent during the reference week. For persons who were not working but had a job or business, those who fit into the cases listed below should be considered as ‘working’: - employees (including those on holidays, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave) - long-term absent from work - seasonal workers - maternity and paternity leave - unpaid family workers (including those on holidays, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave) - self-employed persons (including those on holidays, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave) - not working because of lay-off - slack work for technical or economic reasons. A detailed description of each case to be considered as ‘working’ is provided below. Did any work for pay or profit during the reference week (LFS definition) ‘Work’ means any work for pay or profit during the reference week, even for as little as 1 hour. Pay includes cash payments or payment in kind (payment in goods or services rather than money), whether payment was received in the week the work was done or not. Anyone who receives wages for on-the-job training that involves the production of goods or services is also counted as working. Self-employed persons with a business, farm or professional practice are also considered to be working if one of the following applies: - A person working in their own business, professional practice or farm for the purpose of earning a profit, even if the enterprise is failing to make a profit."
PL025,AVAILABLE FOR WORK,"This covers a person who is currently available for work, i.e. was available for paid employment or self- employment before the end of the 2 weeks following the reference week. ‘Currently available' means that if a job were found at the time of the interview, the person would be able to start working within 2 weeks. Testing for availability in the 2 weeks after the interview is considered more appropriate than testing during the reference week, because some persons may be unavailable for work during the reference week due to obstacles that might have been overcome had they known that a job was available to them. Persons who found a job to start later, i.e. within 3 months, should be encoded ‘Yes’. Suggested question: FILTER: If PL035=1 >> go to the next question PL025_Q1: If a job became available, would you be able to start within the next 2 weeks? 1. Yes 2. No"
PL020,ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR JOB,"This variable only applies to persons aged 16-74 who are not currently working, where ‘working’ refers to the self-defined status as recorded in PL035: worked at least 1 hour during the previous week. However, people above the standard retirement age are not covered by this variable. In these cases, the filter is applied to skip over the question that asks for information in this variable. The period of reference for this variable is the past 4 weeks, ending with the reference week. The answer will be ‘Yes’ if the person has been actively looking for a job over the past 4 weeks. The answer ‘Yes’ should be recorded only if the person has used an active method of looking for a job. Education and training are considered as ways of improving employability but not as active method of looking for a job. Persons who found a job that began later, i.e. within a period of at least 3 months, should be encoded ‘Yes’. Active methods of looking for a job: - having been in contact with a public employment office to find work, whoever took the initiative (renewing registration for administrative reasons only is not an active method); - having been in contact with a private agency (temporary employment agency, firm specialising in recruitment, etc.) to find work; - applying to employers directly; - asking friends, relatives, trade unions, etc. to help find work; - placing or answering job advertisements; - studying job advertisements; - taking a recruitment test or examination or sitting an interview; - looking for land, premises or equipment;"
PL120,REASON FOR WORKING LESS THAN 30 HOURS,"This variable is intended to capture the idea of underemployment (working fewer hours than the person would prefer because they cannot find a job working more hours; see for example the Working Group on Employment Statistics, 2001b). The target variable in EU-SILC will not capture a fully harmonised definition of underemployment, however: to do so would require a larger number of items than the space constraints permit. The cut-off filter for the EU-SILC item is set relatively high (at 30 hours for all of the jobs) so as to capture as many as possible of those people who wish to work a greater number of hours. This variable refers to the main reason for working less than 30 hours. Only one response, therefore, must be selected. In cases where more than one reason applies and the main reason is not clear, the list should be treated in order of priority, with code 1 indicating the highest priority and code 7 the lowest. For a description of what should be counted as the number of hours worked, please refer to the description included in PL060 (Number of hours usually worked per week in the main job). Suggested question: FILTER: IF PL032≠1 or (PL032=1 and PL060 + PL100 >=30) >> go to the next question Person is working (PL032=1) and PL060 + PL100<30 >> go to PL120_Q1 PL120_Q1: What is the main reason why you are working [NUMBER OF HOURS] (less than 30) hours per week? 1 2 3 4 5 6 Undergoing education or training Personal illness or disability Wants to work more hours but cannot find a job(s) or work of more hours Does not want to work more hours Number of hours in all job(s) are considered as a full-time job Housework, looking after children or other persons"
PL280,LENGTH OF REGISTRATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT,"This variable should be collected only among persons who in PL211A to PL211L gave the answer ‘5’. It collects information on the period of unemployment during the income reference period. ‘Registered’ should be understood as a person who was registered with the local unemployment office as unemployed. Suggested question: FILTER: If PL211A to PL211L ≠ 5 or RB081≠16-74 >> go to the next question PL280_Q1: You said that you have been unemployed during the last calendar year. During this period of unemployment, have you been registered as such for: 1. The whole period 2. Part of the period 3. Not registered at all"
PE030,YEAR WHEN HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION,"The ‘year when the highest level of education was successfully completed’ refers to the educational attainment as reported in variable ‘educational attainment level’ (PE041), and its implementation guidelines apply accordingly. If the respondent does not know the exact date (e.g. when there is a proxy respondent), an estimation should be provided. Auxiliary questions on the age of the respondent when completing the highest level of education or how many years ago the highest level of education was completed should be asked to allow an estimation if the respondent does not remember the year. One possible way to estimate ‘year when the highest level of education was attained’ is based on the year of birth and the age at completion of the highest level of education or, if unknown, the usual duration (without interruption) for a particular level of educational attainment. Where two vocational qualifications are obtained from programmes at the same ISCED level, the most recent qualification should be used for completing the variable ‘year of the successful completion of the highest educational level’ and for giving the field of this education programme. Successful completion of programmes at ISCED levels 2 or 3, which gives access to programmes at a higher ISCED level (which for ISCED level 3 is ISCED levels 5, 6 or 7), is considered as level completion. The flag ‘-2 not applicable' covers individuals with no formal education or an educational attainment level below ISCED 1. The variable refers to the year when the highest level of education was successfully completed and is expressed in four digits."
PE050,EDUCATION INTERRUPTED OR ABANDONED,"Formal education or training is defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 (ISCED 2011), see http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard- classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf ‘Formal education and training interrupted or abandoned’ means that a person has started a formal education programme, but has not successfully completed this programme. According to ISCED 2011, ‘a common characteristic of an education programme is that, upon fulfilment of learning objectives or educational tasks, successful completion is certified.’ Accordingly, abandoning formal education is defined as leaving formal education without certification or a diploma, and without obtaining the final credential associated with this formal education. This variable aims to find out if respondents ever started but did not successfully complete a formal education programme. In addition to the information provided in PE041 Educational attainment level, this variable provides a general picture of people who have ever started but then not completed some other formal education (‘dropouts’). It also makes possible some further analyses of people with a low level of education (i.e. whether a person with at most lower secondary education ever started upper secondary education but then left without attaining a qualification at this level). There is no specific reference period, i.e. the variable covers all formal education activities abandoned during the life of the person. There is a limitation in the age group; this variable needs to be asked only for persons aged 16-34 years old. If a person changes their field of studies, then this is considered as abandoning formal education. For example, a person who started a bachelor programme in social sciences, then stopped without successfully completing it (i.e. without receiving the certification) and then started a bachelor programme in economics is"
HS160,"PROBLEMS WITH THE DWELLING: TOO DARK,","The objective is to assess whether the respondent feels that ‘the dwelling is too dark, without enough daylight’ is a problem for the household. No common objective standards as to what a ‘problem’ means are implied. The question asks whether the household feels that there is a problem with most of the rooms being too dark (not necessarily all of the rooms). It is recommended to consider whether the dwelling is ‘too dark, without enough daylight’ on a sunny day, which means that artificial lighting should not be taken into account. Suggested question: HS160_Q1: Is your dwelling too dark, meaning is there not enough daylight coming through the windows? 1. Yes 2. No"
HS170,NOISE FROM NEIGHBOURS OR FROM THE,"The objective is to assess whether the respondent feels that ‘noise from neighbours or from outside’ is a problem for the household (not whether they are bothered by the problem). No common standards as to what constitutes a problem are defined. A reference to the dwelling should be clearly indicated both in the national questionnaires and in the national interviewers’ guidelines. Both aspects of noise from neighbours and outside are to be covered and specified in the question as well as in the interviewers’ guidelines. In relation to ‘noise from neighbours’, no details are to be included in the question itself. In the interviewers’ guidelines, noise from neighbours could be described as noise from a neighbouring apartment, staircase or water pipe, for example. Reference is to be made to ‘noise from outside’ and not to ‘noise from the street’. 'Noise from outside' should be made explicit in the question. In the national questionnaires, traffic, businesses, factories, etc. should be specified in brackets. In the interviewers’ guidelines, 'noise from outside' should be described as noise linked to traffic (street or road, plane, railway), linked to businesses, factories, agricultural activities, clubs and yard. This information should be included as an item under a single question. Suggested question: HS170_Q1: Do you have any of the following problems related to the place where you live: too much noise in your dwelling from neighbours or from outside (traffic, a business, a factory, etc.)? 1. Yes 2. No"
HC020,SIZE OF THE DWELLING IN SQUARE METRES,"The dwelling size refers to the useful floor space using the same definition as for the population and housing census and as recommended in the Programme of Current Housing and Building Statistics for Countries in the UNECE Region (Statistical Standards and Studies No. 43). Useful floor space is defined as the floor space measured inside the outer walls, excluding non-habitable cellars and attics and, in multi-dwelling buildings, all common spaces. Households should declare the area of dwelling that can be used exclusively. If part of the dwelling area is shared with other households (within the same dwelling), the procedure is as follows: − if the number of persons living in all households occupying the same dwelling is known, the shared area should be divided by the number of persons living there and that part of the shared area should be added to each household according to the number of members; − if only the number of households occupying the same dwelling is known, the shared area should be divided by the number of households and an equal share should be added to each household; − in all other cases, the shared space should be added to each household. The square metres divided by the number of occupants in a dwelling is needed to measure the dwelling density. Suggested question: HC020_Q1: What is the size of your dwelling, in square metres? If you don’t know, please give an estimate. [It refers to the floor space measured inside the outer walls, excluding non-habitable cellars and attics. In multi-dwelling buildings it excludes all common spaces] _____________square metres (number, 0-999)"
HC080,OVERALL SATISFACTION WITH THE DWELLING,"The variable refers to the respondent’s degree of satisfaction with the dwelling in terms of meeting the household’s needs, and their opinion of the price (the financial burden related to the main dwelling). This also takes into account the space, neighbourhood, and distance to work, quality of the dwelling and other aspects. The assessment is based on the respondent’s own perception of their dwelling. If the respondent has several dwellings, they should refer to the main dwelling only. Suggested question: HC080_Q1: Overall, how satisfied is your household with your dwelling? [Consider the main dwelling only] 1. Very dissatisfied 2. Dissatisfied 3. Satisfied 4. Very satisfied"
HY030,IMPUTED RENT,"The imputed rent refers to the value that must be imputed for all households that do not report themselves as paying full rent, either because they are owner-occupiers or they live in accommodation rented at a lower price than the market price, or because the accommodation is provided rent-free. The imputed rent must be estimated only for those dwellings (and any associated buildings such as garages) that are used as a main residence by the households. The value to impute is the equivalent rent that must be paid for a similar dwelling as that occupied, less: (i) any rent actually paid (if the accommodation is rented at a lower price than the market price), (ii) expenditure on minor repairs or refurbishment. Costs for heating, water electricity, etc. are excluded. Repairs leading to improvements or fixing major problems in the dwelling are also excluded. If the respondent is identified as a ‘Tenant or subtenant paying rent at the prevailing or market rate’ (HH021 =3), the value recorded for this variable should be 0. Depreciation (consumption of fixed capital) must not be taken into account because it is likely to be offset or superseded by variation in the market value of the dwelling. These are not covered in EU-SILC. The market rent is the rent due for the right to use an unfurnished dwelling on the private market, excluding charges for heating, water, electricity, etc. By extension, the private market also includes the market that is regulated by government regulations. Several methods for estimating ‘gross’68 imputed rent are available: - the regression/stratification method based on actual rents; - the user cost method based on the estimation of cost incurred for homeownership by foregoing the opportunity to invest in financial assets from which real income flows are created by interest and dividends; - the self-assessment method; - the administrative assessment method, generally for fiscal purposes; For the sake of comparability between countries, a regression/stratification method should be applied, except for duly justified cases, in particular when the private rental market represents less than 10% of the market 68 i.e. before deduction of owner cost for maintenance and minor repairs."
HH040,"LEAKING ROOF, DAMP","The aim of this variable is to obtain an objective measure of the condition of the dwelling; whether the dwelling has a problem with a leaking roof and/or damp ceilings, dampness in the walls, floors or foundations and/or rot in window frames and doors. Suggested question: HH040_Q1: Do you have any of the following problems with your dwelling/accommodation? - A leaking roof - Damp walls/floors/foundations -     Rot in window frames or floor 1. Yes 2. No"
HS140,FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE TOTAL HOUSING,"The objective is to assess the respondent’s feelings about the extent to which housing costs are a financial burden on the household. That should be clearly indicated/specified both in the national questionnaires and in the related interviewers’ guidelines. Total mortgage repayments, including instalments and interest, are to be taken into account for owners. For renters, actual rent is to be taken into account. In addition, service charges (sewage removal, rubbish collection, regular maintenance, repairs and other charges) are to be taken into account. Only those housing costs that are actually paid have to be taken into account, i.e. the variable should cover what the household should actually pay and should not take into account the accumulation of arrears over past periods. For the definition of housing costs, please refer to explanations given for variable HH070. Suggested question: HS140_Q1: Please consider your total housing costs including mortgage repayments (instalments and interest) or rent, insurance and service charges (sewage removal, rubbish collection, regular maintenance, repairs and other charges). To what extent are these costs a financial burden on you? [Please note: only actual paid housing costs have to be taken into account] Would you say they are: 1. A heavy burden; 2. A slight burden; 3. No burden at all."
HS180,"POLLUTION, GRIME OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL","The objective is to assess whether the respondent feels ‘pollution, grime, etc.…’ to be a problem for the household (not whether they are bothered by the problem). No common standards as to what constitutes a problem are defined. A reference to the local area (situated close to where the respondent lives) should be clearly indicated both in the national questionnaires and in the national interviewers’ guidelines. A detailed list of examples (road dust, exhaust gases from vehicles; smoke, dust or unpleasant smells from factories; unpleasant smells from waste or sewage; polluted water from water pipes as well as polluted rivers) is proposed for inclusion only in the interviewers’ guidelines, not in national questionnaires. An explicit reference to the specific problem caused by traffic or industry is not to be included in the national questionnaires, but is to be included in the interviewers’ guidelines. This question should be included as an item under a single question. Suggested question: HS180_Q1: Do you have any of the following problems related to the place where you live: pollution, grime or other environmental problems such as smoke, dust, unpleasant smells or polluted water? 1. Yes 2. No"
HS190,"CRIME, VIOLENCE OR VANDALISM IN THE AREA","The objective is to assess whether the respondent feels ‘crime, violence or vandalism’ to be a problem for the household (not whether they are bothered by the problem). No common standards as to what constitutes a problem are defined. A reference to the area (situated close to the place where you live) should be clearly indicated both in the national questionnaires and in the national interviewers’ guidelines. A clear definition is to be provided for ‘crime’: the translation of the word ‘crime’ is to be carefully checked as it has a different meaning in different languages. Crime is to be defined as a deviant behaviour that violates prevailing norms, specifically, cultural standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. A legalistic approach is not to be used (this is not defined as any blameworthy act or omission prohibited by law and penalised by the state). Examples are only to be given in the interviewers’ guidelines and can include thefts or illegal activities. This question should be included as an item under a single question. Suggested question: HS190_Q1: Do you have any of the following problems related to the place where you live: crime, violence and vandalism in the local area? 1. Yes 2. No"
HH081,BATH OR SHOWER IN DWELLING (OPTIONAL),"This variable replaces, from the 2008 operation onwards, the HH080 variable defined in the EU-SILC Regulation. A shower unit or bathtub outside the dwelling are not to be considered in this item. However, the shower unit or the bath do not have to occupy a separate room. Suggested question: HH081_Q1: Is there a shower unit or bathtub in your dwelling? 1. Yes, for the sole use of the household 2. Yes, shared 3. No"
HH091,INDOOR FLUSHING TOILET FOR SOLE USE OF,"This variable replaces, from the 2008 operation onwards, the HH090 variable defined in the EU-SILC Regulation69. Flushing toilets outside the dwelling are not to be considered in this item. However, a flushing toilet in a room with a shower unit or a bath should be counted. Suggested question: HH091_Q1: Is there an indoor flushing toilet in your dwelling? 1. Yes, for the sole use of the household 2. Yes, shared 3. No 69 The Living Conditions Working Group agreed during its meeting in 2010 to delete HH090 and to keep only HH091 from the 2011 operation onwards."
PT220,TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD WHEN RESPONDENT WAS,"The respondent is asked to provide information on the type of household where they lived when they were around 14 years old. Collective households or institutions are for instance: hospitals, children’s homes, residential homes, correction facilities, military barracks, religious institutions, boarding houses and workers’ hostels, etc. Boarding schools are not to be considered as institutional households. For a respondent who alternated between two households and spent an equal amount of time with both legal guardians or parents (when they were around 14 years old), the household in which the respondent was officially registered (recorded in the population register or passport or some other document) should be the one considered. The household considered could also be the one of the legal guardian or the parent who received the child benefits or who contributed more towards the child-related costs. If none of the above are applicable, the household in which the respondent felt more at home should be considered. Suggested question: FILTER: IF Age < 25 or Age > 59, then >> Go to the next question IF 25 ≤ Age ≤ 59 >> go to PT220_Q1 PT220_Q1: In what type of household did you live when you were around 14 years old? 1. Private household 2. Lived in a collective household or institution"
PT230,PRESENCE OF MOTHER WHEN RESPONDENT WAS,"This variable aims to obtain information on whether the respondent’s mother was present in their life. If the respondent did not live with their mother, it collects information on whether the respondent had contact with the parent. The mother should be considered as a person who actually raised the respondent and acted as their mother, e.g. the female guardian, stepmother, adoptive mother, mother figure, etc. If the mother did not live in the same household and the respondent had no contact with them, further information about the mother should not be collected. If the parents of the respondent were divorced or separated and shared custody (50% of the time for each parent), the respondent has the option to: - select their household on an objective basis, taking into account their main address when they were around 14 years old (i.e. the one in the population register and/or on their ID card or passport); - select their household on a subjective basis according to where they felt more at home when they were around 14 years old. If the parents of the respondent were divorced or separated and did not share custody equally, the household should be the one where the respondent lived all or most of the time. For a person with two male parents, this variable could be used to report the presence of one of the fathers."
PT240,PRESENCE OF FATHER WHEN RESPONDENT WAS,"This variable aims to obtain information on whether the father of the respondent was present in their life. If the respondent did not live with their parent, it collects information on whether respondent had contact with the parent. The father should be considered as a person who actually raised the respondent and acted as their father, e.g. the male guardian, stepfather, adoptive father, father figure, etc. If the father did not live in the same household and the respondent had no contact with the parent, further information about the father should not be collected. If the parents of the respondent were divorced or separated and shared custody (50% of the time for each parent), the respondent has the option to: - select their household on an objective basis, taking into account their main address when they were around 14 years old (i.e. the one in the population register and/or on their ID card or passport); - select their household on a subjective basis according to where they felt more at home when they were around 14 years old. If the parents of the respondent were divorced or separated and did not share custody equally, the household should be the one where the respondent lived all or most of the time. For a person with two female parents, this variable could be used to report the presence of one of the mothers.

PT070,CITIZENSHIP OF THE FATHER (OPTIONAL),"The citizenship that the respondent’s father (or the person they considered to be their father) had during the reference period (i.e. when the respondent was around 14 years old). Citizenship means the particular legal bond between an individual and their state, acquired by birth or naturalisation, whether by declaration, choice, marriage or other means according to national legislation. It generally corresponds to the country issuing the passport. For persons with multiple citizenships and where one of these is citizenship of the country of residence, that citizenship should be encoded. Information on the country of main citizenship should be obtained in accordance with the current administrative status or legal situation of the individual. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO, which is largely based on the ISO 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The short list of country codes corresponds to the Ramon (GEO) classification as defined in the Annex to the guidelines for standardised variables and is included in Annex 10. The category ‘stateless’ corresponds to a person without recognised citizenship of a state (STLS). The flag ‘-1’ will be used to count statistical units that are part of the population of the data source but for which it systematically does not report any information on that variable. The category ‘country of main citizenship’ (SCL GEO code) may also be used for the transmission of information on ‘recognised non-citizens’. A recognised non-citizen is a person who is not a citizen of the reporting country nor of any other country, but who has established links to that country that include some but not all of the rights and obligations of full citizenship. A majority of such persons were citizens of the former Soviet Union living in the Baltic"

PT210,TENANCY STATUS WHEN RESPONDENT WAS,"The tenancy status refers to the accommodation in which the respondent was living when they were around 14 years old. If the respondent’s tenancy status changed during the reference period, the answer should be based on the accommodation in which the respondent spent most of their time during the period. Owned: Accommodation is considered to be owned if (at least) one of the members of the household has a title deed to the accommodation. If, for instance, the accommodation was provided by a relative (such as by the respondent’s grandparents) who was not a member of the household, then it should be recorded as either ‘rented’ or ‘accommodation was provided free’, depending on whether or not rent was paid by this household. Households that had an outstanding mortgage for the purchase of the accommodation or paid part rent and part mortgage for their accommodation should be classified as ‘owners’ if they possessed a title deed. Rented: The tenant was a member of the household. It includes tenants or subtenants paying rent at the prevailing or market rate or at a reduced rate. Accommodation was provided free: ‘Accommodation was provided free’ applies only when there was no rent to be paid, such as when the accommodation came with the job, or was provided rent-free. This includes cases where free rent is granted by law as a result of a social housing scheme, for private reasons or by an employer.

PT260,BASIC SCHOOL NEEDS (BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT,"This variable holds for the entire group of children aged between 1 and 18 who were attending school and residing in the household of the respondent when they were around 14 years old. The objective is to determine whether the basic school needs of the respondent and other children in their household were met when the respondent was around 14 years old. Even if the needs of only one child were not met, the entire group of children in the household are assumed not to have had their needs met. Even if only one child did not have their basic school needs met because the household could not afford it, then the answer category should be ‘No, due to financial reasons’. ’Basic school needs’ should be understood as e.g. books and equipment needed for school.

PT280,ONE WEEK OF ANNUAL HOLIDAY AWAY FROM HOME,"This variable holds for the entire group of children aged between 1 and 18 who were residing in the household of the respondent when they were around 14 years old. The objective is to determine if the respondent and other children in their household had at least 1 week of holiday away from home each year when the respondent was around 14 years old. Even if only one child did not have a holiday away from home for at least 1 week a year, the entire group of children in the household are assumed not to have had these holidays either. Even if only one child did not have such a holiday because the household could not afford it, then the answer category should be ‘No, due to financial reasons’. The children of the household did not have to go on holiday together and at the same time. If every child of the household went on holiday away from home at least 1 week a year, the answer should be ‘Yes’ whatever the context (holidays with family, relatives, friends, a youth organisation, a school trip, etc.). If there was a child within the household who did not go on holiday because of health problems (and the household could afford to pay for holidays for all of its children), then the answer should be ‘No, other reasons’. ‘1 week’ means 7 days. ‘Holiday’ should be understood as: holidays with family, relatives, friends, a youth organisation, a school trip, etc. Suggested question: FILTER: IF [Age < 25 or Age > 59] or PT220=2 >> go to the next question IF 25 ≤ Age ≤ 59 and PT220 = 1 >> go to PT280_Q1 PT280_Q1: Did all the children in your household go on holiday away from home for at least 1 week a year when you were around 14 years old? 1. Yes 2. No, due to financial reasons 3. No, other reasons"
HC001,HEATING SYSTEM USED,"This variable describes the type of main heating system used in the dwelling. The purpose is to identify where the heat is generated: (i) outside the building premises (district heating or teleheating); (ii) in common and at the level of the building premises (central heating); (iii) at dwelling level (individual heating); or (iv) through a portable heating source that can be moved from one room to another (non-fixed heating). In multi-dwelling buildings, the heating system can be the same for all dwellings or differ between them. If more than one system is used for heating, the main one should be selected. The reference period in this variable is the current one; however, it should reflect the general situation. If the data is collected during warm months and no heating system is being used at the time of the interview, respondents should provide information about the heating system usually used during cold months. A district heating network (also known as a heat network or teleheating) is the distribution of thermal energy in the form of steam or hot water from a central source of production through a network to multiple buildings or sites, for the use of space or process heating. A central heating system is used if thermal energy is provided either from an installation in the building or in its immediate proximity, installed to heat several building units, without regard to the source of energy. Central heating differs from district heating in that heat generation occurs in one place, such as a furnace room or basement in the building, and is distributed throughout the building. An individual heating system is located only in the dwelling and includes different ways of distributing heat inside the room or rooms, e.g. stove, radiators, boiler. Non-fixed heating includes portable heaters such as an electric radiator or a fan heater, which can be easily moved from one room to another."
HC002,MAIN ENERGY SOURCE,"This variable identifies the main energy source used for heating the main dwelling. In multi-dwelling buildings, the heating system can be the same for all dwellings or differ between them. If more than one source of energy is used for heating, the main one should be selected. The main energy source should be the one that is mostly used and/or serves the biggest part of the dwelling in terms of floor area/surface. Electricity includes air conditioners, fixed electric radiators or floor heating. Gas includes heating using natural gas, propane, liquefied gas or butane. The heating could be distributed to the whole dwelling (e.g. a pipeline for gas) or not (e.g. stove with gas). Oil as a source of heating includes oil heaters, oil-filled heaters, oil-filled radiators or column heaters. Biomass includes pellet fuels (or pellets) that are compressed organic matter or biomass using wood or small woodchips, nutshells, corn kernels, etc. Wood logs are large pieces of wood that could be used for heating. In this category, wood sawed into boards, planks, etc. can also be considered. Coal includes heating using coal, lignite and the products of coal and lignite. Renewable energy used for heating includes solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, heat pumps, etc. The heating system used for dwellings other than the main one should not be considered."
HC003,"RENOVATION (THERMAL INSULATION, WINDOWS OR","This variable identifies whether the dwelling70 was renovated in the last 5 years to improve its energy efficiency (e.g. thermal insulation, windows or heating system replaced, etc.). All renovations that have had an effect on the dwelling’s thermal conditions should be considered and counted. For instance, even if only one window in the dwelling was replaced in the last 5 years, as opposed to all the windows, the information should still be accounted for this variable. The following renovation measures should be included: - improvement in thermal insulation of external walls, roof or floor; - replacement of single glazed windows with double or triple glazed windows; - replacement of the heating system with a more efficient one. Relevant measures include renovations done either in the whole building or only in the dwelling; and renovations done or arranged by the household or by somebody else, e.g. the owner of the property. Measures to be taken into account should not include minor renovation work that did not change the dwelling’s condition or energy efficiency level. For buildings which are less than 5 years as well as all other buildings which for whatever reason have not gone through energy renovation, the answer modality ‘4-No’ should be used. 70 A dwelling is a room or suite of rooms – including its accessories, lobbies and corridors – in a permanent building or a structurally separated part of a building which, by the way it has been built, rebuilt or converted, is designed for habitation by one private household all year round. A dwelling can be either a one-family dwelling in a stand-alone building or detached edifice, or an apartment in a block of flats. Dwellings include garages for residential use, even when apart from the habitation or belonging to different owners (Retrieved from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Dwelling)."
HC060,INABILITY TO KEEP THE DWELLING COMFORTABLY,"This variable identifies whether the household is able to keep the dwelling comfortably warm in winter, taking into account the insulation of the dwelling and the heating system in place. The purpose for this variable is to address the following concerns: ’Is the heating system used enough to keep the dwelling warm?’ and/or ‘Is the dwelling sufficiently insulated against the cold?’.
