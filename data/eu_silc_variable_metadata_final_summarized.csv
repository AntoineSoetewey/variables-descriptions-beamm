Variable Name,Short Description,Long Description (Summarized)
DB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"The year in which the survey-data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
DB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2). The SCL GEO is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CL_GE O&StrLanguageCode=EN&IntPcKey=&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC.
DB030,HOUSEHOLD ID,"When there is a fusion of two sample households and the new household is located at an address where one of the households was previously interviewed the new household should keep the household number and split number of the household at that address in the previous wave. When the new household is located at a new address, the household number and split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ should be used."
DB040,REGION OF RESIDENCE,"NUTS (2-digits) For Member States of the EU, regions are defined on the basis of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) as described in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (as amended)22 and Annex I. From 2021 onwards Under Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council all Member States’ statistics that are submitted to the Commission (Eurostat) and that are to be broken down by territorial units should use the NUTS classification."
DB050,STRATUM,"In case the target population is stratified at the first stage of the sampling design (or in case of comparable sample design), all primary strata receive a unique identification code which remains the same for the entire period in which the observation units (individual or household) that receive this identification code remain in 24 Self-representing PSUs are PSUs selected with a probability of 1, which must be considered to be a stratum rather than a PSU.. The category 'not applicable' is to be used in case the target population has not been stratified at the first stage of the sampling process (e.g., when the sample has been drawn by simple random sampling or by cluster random sampling), and self-representing PSUs have not been considered."
DB060,PRIMARY SAMPLING UNITS [PSU],"The category 'primary sampling unit identifier' provides the identification code of the selected PSU each observation unit (individual or household) belongs to, in case the target population has been divided into clusters in the first stage of sampling. A population is divided into clusters (i.e., disjoint sub-populations) in case direct-element sampling is either impossible (due to lack of a sampling frame) or too expensive to implement (the population is widely distributed geographically)."
DB062,SECONDARY SAMPLING UNITS [SSU],"If direct-element sampling is either impossible (lack of sampling frame) or too expensive to implement (the population is widely distributed geographically), multi-stage selections can be done. If the first stage of the sample design consists of a selection of households, households receive a unique code for variable DB060 that remains the same throughout EU-SILC’s entire duration."
DB070,ORDER OF SELECTION OF PSU,"In order to facilitate the computation of the standard errors for i) the common EU indicators, ii) the equivalised disposable income, iii)  the unadjusted gender pay gap and iv)  a list of income components, countries should28 fill in this (these) variable(s) (in the case of systematic selection) for all panels and waves in the file, and not 28 Agreement during the Living Conditions Working Group meeting in June 2009. If primary sampling units (or households in case of direct-element sampling) are selected systematically, DB070 contains the rank of selection of those units, order of selection of PSU, and order of selection of PSU as used in the selection of the sample."
DB075,ROTATION GROUP,"Regarding the numbering of the rotation groups over time, it is recommended that each rotation group keeps the same number throughout the period of the survey (see figure hereafter): PATTERN FOR ENUMERATION OF ROTATIONAL GROUPS new rotational group old rotational group Year of survey t 1 2 3 4 t+1 2 3 4 1 t+2 3 4 1 2 t+3 4 1 2 3 t+4 1 2 3 4 t+5 t+6 In case of 6 years rotation used. In the case of a rotational design based on four replications with a rotation of one replication per year, one of the replications must be dropped immediately after the first year, the second must be retained for 2 years, the third for 3 years, and the fourth for 4 years."
DB076,INTERVIEW WAVE,"If the household is in the sample for the second time, the value 2 should be selected, value 3 for the third time, value 4 for the fourth time, etc. If the household is in the data sample for the first time, the value 1 should be selected."
DB080,HOUSEHOLD DESIGN WEIGHT,"A classical procedure consists of modifying the design weights by a factor inversely proportional to the response rate within each ‘homogeneous group’, in which the response probabilities are assumed to be equal: 𝐷𝐵080ℎ (𝑁) = 𝐷𝐵080ℎ ⋅ 1 𝑅𝐾 Where RK denotes s the (weighted) response rate in the group (k) the household (h) belongs to: 𝑅𝐾   =  𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑒𝑙 𝑘 𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑘 See construction of weights in the first part of section 8: weights.. DB080 is computed as follows: In the case that households are sampled (or addresses or other units containing households): 𝐷𝐵080ℎ = 1 / (probability of selection of h) In the case that persons are sampled: 𝐷𝐵080ℎ = 1 /  (probabilities of selection of eligible persons in h) ‘Eligible persons’ are people who are given a non-zero probability in the selection procedure, such as people aged 16+."
DB090,HOUSEHOLD CROSS-SECTIONAL WEIGHT,"More precisely, suppose that there are ‘J’ auxiliary variables x1…xj…xJ, called calibration variables, with known population totals (for the numerical variables) or marginal counts (for the categorical variables). The household cross-sectional weights (target variable DB090) will be used to draw inference on the population of private households at national and European levels (see the weight for DB080 and then further)."
DB095,HOUSEHOLD LONGITUDINAL WEIGHT,"In year X, after the non-response adjustment that is applied to each rotational group separately, each rotational group should be calibrated separately to the cross-sectional population referring to the end of the year X-1. The variable DB095 should be adjusted backwards with every data transmission because the number of surveyed rotational groups change with the evolution of the panel."
DB100,DEGREE OF URBANISATION,"For further information, see: Local Administrative Units (LAU) - NUTS - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics - Eurostat (europa.eu) Modalities used before: - Densely populated area: contiguous grid cells of 1km2 with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50,000. The LAU2 list including the degree of urbanisation is published by Eurostat on the RAMON server: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/miscellaneous/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_DEGURBA."
DB110,HOUSEHOLD STATUS,"New address added to the sample in this wave or first wave: This situation occurs where for the first time this household is recorded in the survey and is not a split-off household (first wave, new household introduced into the sample in order to maintain the sample size because of loss due to non-response). Entire household moved to a private household within the country: This situation appears when no sample persons live at the same address as in the previous wave, but when the household moved to a private household within the country."
DB120,CONTACT AT ADDRESS,"23 Address/phone non-contacted: non-existent/non-residential or non-private/unoccupied/not principal residence should be recorded when: - an address is non-residential if it is used for different purposes than those of a principal residence (business, shop, vacation home, etc.). 22 Address/phone non-contacted: unable to access should be recorded when: - it is not possible to access the address due to weather factors (like flooding, etc.) or geographic factors, for example, there may be no access roads."
DB130,HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE RESULT,"21-24 Interview not completed: In the case of an interview survey, at least three call-backs must be made before a household is considered as being non-responsive (interview not completed), unless there are clear reasons (such as a definite refusal to cooperate, circumstances endangering the safety of the interviewer, etc.) why this household cannot be interviewed. In the case where a one-person household is unable to respond to or self-administer the questionnaire due to incapacity or illness, the interviewer should, if feasible, try to contact someone outside the household who is able to help or provide the information on behalf of the incapacitated person."
DB135,HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW ACCEPTANCE,"In those countries for which a selected respondent is chosen for the personal interview, the interview of the selected respondent must be completed.. The interview must be accepted for the database if at least one of the personal interviews is completed."
HB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"Year in which the survey data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
HB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,"To the extent to which all possible participants in a specific social micro data-collection need to be usual residents, and the country of residence of all the reporting units corresponds to the reporting country. The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2)."
HB030,HOUSEHOLD ID,"In the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at a previous address, it must retain the Household number and Split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave. If the new household is at a new address, the Household number and Split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in ‘the household register’ will be retained."
HB040,DAY OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,"‘Day of household interview’ means the day in which the data are collected, or the household is interviewed."
HB050,MONTH OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,"‘Month of household interview’ means the month in which the data are collected, or the household is interviewed."
HB060,YEAR OF HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW,‘Year of household interview’ means the year in which the data is collected or the household is interviewed.
HB070,PERSON RESPONDING TO THE HOUSEHOLD,"For the second and following waves, the household respondent will be chosen according to the following list of priority: Priority (1): the household respondent in the last wave Priority (2): a ‘sample person’ aged 16 and over giving priority to the person responsible for the accommodation or the best placed to provide the information. For instance, if the ‘selected respondent’ is the 16-year old son or daughter, this person is highly unlikely to be able to provide good quality information on such issues as mortgage or rent payments, housing costs, income from family and other benefits."
HB100,NUMBER OF MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE,The value of this variable refers to the count of minutes required to fill the household interview.
HB110,HOUSEHOLD TYPE,"Household type is defined by a private household composition, where: - A 'couple' is defined as a pair of individuals considered as partners in terms of their actual living arrangements within the household, regardless of whether the relationship with the partner is legally registered (e.g., marriage or civil union) or a de facto relationship (cohabiting partners). 'Adoption' means taking and treating a biological child of other parents as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country whereby means of a judicial process the adopted child - whether related or not to the adopter - acquires the rights and status of a biological child born to the adopting parents."
HB120,HOUSEHOLD SIZE,"When the information is collected during the interview the recommended question should be: ""How many people usually live in your household? Please include yourself."". This variable is introduced as part of the list of standardised variables and will be implemented from 2021 onwards."
HB130,INTERVIEW MODE USED (HOUSEHOLD),"For example, in a situation where a person has been first contacted by phone and some data (main part) has been collected via computer assisted web-interview (CAWI) but the missing data (remaining part) is collected at a later stage via computer assisted personal interview (CAPI), the variable should report on CAWI as the interviewing mode used. When administrative and survey data and/or different interviewing modes are combined–, it is recommended to retain the information on the data collection method and on the interviewing mode used at the variable level."
HH010,DWELLING TYPE,"Dwelling is generally defined as a room or suite of rooms and its accessories (e.g., lobbies, corridors) in a permanent building or structurally separated part thereof, which, by the way it has been built, rebuilt or converted, is designed for habitation by one private household. Semi-detached: Semi-detached refers to two dwellings sharing at least one wall, and ‘terraced’ refers to a row of (more than two) joined-up dwellings, we would consider houses in which are more than one dwelling, sharing at least one wall (or ceiling) but have separate entrances."
HH021,TENURE STATUS,"Owner paying mortgage: An owner is considered as an 'owner paying mortgage' when he/she has to pay 30 An agreement was made at the Living Conditions Working Group meeting in June 2009 that the variable HH020 will be replaced by the variable HH021 with five answer categories. If for instance the accommodation is provided by a relative (such as by parents to their children) who is not a member of the household, then one of the other categories should be selected, depending on whether or not rent is paid by this household."
HH030,NUMBER OF ROOMS AVAILABLE TO THE,"Room: A room is defined as a space of a housing unit of at least four square meters such as bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms and habitable cellars, attics, kitchens and other separated spaces used or intended for dwelling purposes with a height over two meters and accessible from inside the unit. If the dwelling is shared by more than one household and some rooms are shared with other households (within the same dwelling), the number of shared rooms should be divided by the number of households and the equal share should be added to each household."
HH050,ABILITY TO KEEP HOME ADEQUATELY WARM,"This question is about affordability (ability to pay) to keep the home adequately warm, regardless of whether the household actually needs to keep it adequately warm. Suggested question is: Can your household afford to keep its home adequately warm?."
HH060,CURRENT RENT RELATED TO THE OCCUPIED,"For example, if: • The owner requires a rent for the dwelling: 700 € • The household pays the owner (from their own resources): 500 € • The housing allowances (paid directly to the owner or through the household): 200 € (recorded as a part of appropriate housing allowances variables) then: HH060 = 700 €  (= 500 € + 200€), The amount provided should be in the national currency. In cases where part of the rent may be paid through a housing benefit (either paid to the tenant or paid directly to the landlord), the rent paid refers to the total rent payable: that is to the amount paid by the tenant from his or her own income plus the amount paid by housing benefit."
HH070,TOTAL HOUSING COST,"For example, in the case of tenants at reduced price, if: • The household has to pay for the charges (electricity, water, etc.): 300 € • The owner requires a rent for the dwelling: 700 € • The household pays the owner (from their own resources): 500 € • The housing allowances are paid directly to the owner or through the household: 200 € 32 Included only in case of mortgage taken for the purpose of buying the main dwelling 33 Only the regular maintenance and repairs should be included. housing benefits should not be deducted from the total housing cost), structural insurance (if paid by the rent-free tenant), services and charges (sewage removal, refuse removal, etc.) (if paid by the rent-free tenant), taxes on dwelling (if applicable), regular maintenance and repairs and the cost of utilities (water, electricity, gas and heating)."
HH071,MORTGAGE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT,The term mortgage principal repayment (net of any tax relief) refers to monthly payments connected with the households' total housing cost. The HH071 is relevant only for households who are paying the mortgage for their main dwelling or HH021 equal to ‘2’.
HS011,ARREARS ON MORTGAGE OR RENTAL,"However, loans concerning major repairs or other expenses in relation to the main dwelling which cannot be separated from the loan that was used to purchase or to build the main dwelling, could be included in variable HS011. has been unable to pay on time due to financial difficulties for: (a) rent 34 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS010 and to keep only HS011 starting from the 2011 operation."
HS021,ARREARS ON UTILITY BILLS,"The question refers to financial difficulties, therefore, for example, if the household was unable to pay on time once/twice or more as result of lack of money, Only situations when household was unable to cover the costs due to financial difficulties should be recorded. heating, electricity, gas, water, waste disposal etc.) of the main dwelling on time due to financial difficulties? 35 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS020 and to keep only HS021 starting from the 2011 operation."
HS022,REDUCED UTILITY COSTS,The aim of this variable is to collect information if the household has their utility cost reduced or fully covered by central/local government or NPISHs. Not in all countries exist governmental schemes which reduce or cover the cost of utility bills for some groups of population.
HS031,ARREARS ON HIRE PURCHASE INSTALMENTS OR,"Suggested question: In the past twelve months, has the household been in arrears on hire purchase instalments or other loan payments (for example, a car loan, consumer bills, bills from day-care, school, health…), i.e., has been unable to pay these on time due to financial difficulties? 37 The Living conditions Working Group agreed during its 2010 meeting to suppress HS030 and to keep only HS031 starting from the 2011 operation.. For further information or required technical details, a bank overdraft and a negative balance at the ""end of the month statement"" should not, normally, enter into consideration when estimating the arrears status of the household except if not paying has direct consequence for the household situation (fine, disruption of service in case the household does not ensure minimum/full repayment)."
HS040,CAPACITY TO AFFORD PAYING FOR ONE WEEK,"These cases are included in this particular variable because it is not possible to specify the amount that is required for a household to have a week’s holiday every year; in many cases, where the household makes use of its second dwelling for holidays or stays with friends, it could still generate cost and also, the case of subsidized holidays is in fact considered as an ‘invisible’ part of the household’s income. Suggested question: Can your entire household afford to go for a week's annual holiday, away from home, including stays in a second dwelling or with friends/relatives? [Note for the interviewer: ‘Entire household’ does not mean that the members of the household have to go on holiday all together and at the same time]."
HS050,"CAPACITY TO AFFORD A MEAL WITH MEAT,","The variable records whether, according to the household respondent, the household can afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish or equivalent vegetarian every second day, regardless if the household wants it. when parents can afford the refereed meal for the children but cannot afford it for themselves, or when a grown-up son or daughter can afford the refereed meal but other household members cannot)."
HS060,CAPACITY TO FACE UNEXPECTED FINANCIAL,"For the calculation of the amount that should be filled in the questionnaire, the national at-risk-of-poverty threshold has to be used per single consumption unit, which means it has to be used independently of the size and structure of the household. ‘Own resources’ means: • Your household does not ask for financial help from anybody; • Your account has to be debited within the required period; • Your situation regarding potential debts is not deteriorated."
HS090,DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER,"Suggested question: Does your household have a computer? If you do not have a computer: • Would you like to have it but cannot afford it, or • Do you not have one for other reasons e.g., you do not want it or need it.. Possessing the item does not necessarily imply ownership: the item may be rented, leased, provided on loan or shared with other households in (e.g.) a complex apartment and not necessarily owned."
HS110,DO YOU HAVE A CAR,"Suggested question: Does your household have a car/van for private use? If you do not have a car/van: (a) Would you like to have it but cannot afford it, or (b) Do you not have one for other reasons e.g. If the item is shared between households, the answer is ‘YES’ if there is adequate/easy access (i.e., household can use the durable whenever it wants) and ‘NO’ otherwise."
HS120,ABILITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET,"There should be a reference in the national questionnaires as well as in the interviewers' guidelines that all income sources are to be taken into account (possibly irregular) and that ‘more than one household member may contribute to it’. As ‘making ends meet’ does not exist in some languages, it is to be defined as paying usual necessary expenses and should be included both in the national questionnaires and in the guidelines for interviewers."
HS150,FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE REPAYMENT OF,"Do you or anyone in your household have to repay debts from any credit card, hire purchase or other loans (that is, excluding mortgage repayments or other loans connected with the purchase of main dwelling)? If yes, to what extent is the repayment of such loans a financial burden for your household? Would you say it is: a) A heavy burden; b) Somewhat a burden; c) Not a burden at all. The objective is to assess the respondent’s feeling about the extent to which the repayment of non-housing related debts are a financial burden to the household."
HD080,REPLACING WORN-OUT FURNITURE,"The aim of this variable is to collect information if the household could afford to replace furniture when needed (if they are worn out, damaged, broken or out of use) by new or second-hand furniture, not on the intention to replace them during specified reference period. Proposed question: Could you tell me if your household replaces furniture (bed, sofa/dresser, cupboard) when worn out or damaged? 38 Part of additional variables for material deprivation on annex 2013 operation (ESS Agreement of September 2012)."
HI010,CHANGE IN THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,"Suggested question: In the past 12 months, how has your total household income changed? 1 Increased 2 Remained the same 3 Decreased Go to HI020 if HI010=1 Go to HI040 if HI010=2 Go to HI030 if HI010=3. It can be based on respondent’s feeling about the change in income."
HI020,REASON FOR INCREASE IN INCOME,"Suggested question: What was the reason why your household income increased? If there is more than one reason, please choose the most important one: 1 Indexation/ re-evaluation of salary 2 Increased working time/wage or salary (same job) 3 Come back to job market after illness, parenthood, parental leave, child care or to take care of a person with illness or disability 4 Starting or changed job 5 Change in household composition 6 Increase in social benefits 7 Other. Provided reasons refer to change in the degree of occupation, normal life transitions (came back to job market after parenthood, parental leave), household composition change as well as changes related to indexation or social transfers."
HI030,REASON FOR DECREASE IN INCOME,"Suggested question: What was the reason your income decreased? If there is more than one reason, please choose the most important one: 1 Reduced working time/ wage or salary (same job), including self-employment (involuntary) 2 Parenthood/parental leave/child care/to take care of a person with illness or disability 3 Changed job 4 Lost job/unemployment/bankruptcy of (own) enterprise 5 Became unable to work because of illness or disability 6 Divorce/partnership ended /other change to household composition 7 Retirement 8 Cut in social benefits 9 Other. Provided reasons refer to change in the degree of occupation, normal life transitions (having children, retirement), household composition change as well as changes related to social transfers."
HI040,EXPECTATION OF THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN,"Suggested question: When you think of the next 12 months, do you expect the household income to: 1. Based on respondent’s (subjective) opinion."
HY010,TOTAL HOUSEHOLD GROSS INCOME,From 2011 onwards: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total household gross income (HY010). Before 2011: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are not included in the total household gross income (HY010).
HY020,TOTAL DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,From 2011 onwards: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/(PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total disposable household income (HY020). Before 2011: Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/ (PY080N) are not included in the total disposable household income (HY020).
HY022,TOTAL DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/(PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total.
HY023,TOTAL DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME,Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080G)/(PY080N) are treated as a component of property income and should be included in the total.
RB010,YEAR OF THE SURVEY,"Year in which the survey data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
RB020,COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE,The list of countries is defined according to the Eurostat Standard Code list (SCL) GEO which is largely based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 country codes (3166-1 alpha-2).

RB030,PERSONAL ID,Personal ID (maximum eleven digits) = Household ID (maximum nine digits) + personal number (two digits) Personal number: for every new person in the household add 1 to the highest-used persons number (for all the years of the survey and the Household ID) It refers to the number assigned in ‘the household register’ to the person the first time that he/she is recorded as a household member. It should correspond to the person’s line position in ‘the household register’.
RB032,SEQUENTIAL NUMBER OF THE PERSONS IN THE,Example: Wave 2 HH number Split number HH number Split number 123 00 01 123-00-01 123 00 01 123-00-01 123 00 02 123-00-02 123 00 02 123-00-02 123 00 03 123-00-03 123 00 03 123-00-05 123 00 04 123-00-04 123 00 05 123-00-05 HH number Split number RB032 Personal id HH ID 123 01 01 123-00-03 123 01 02 123-00-04 123 01 03 123-01-01 RB032 Personal id RB032 Personal id Wave 1 HH ID HH ID. The number should be unique for each current household member.
RB040,CURRENT HOUSEHOLD IDENTIFICATION (ID),"Household ID (maximum nine digits) = Household number (maximum seven digits) + split number (two digits) When there is no change in the household composition between waves, it keeps the Household number and Split number from one wave to the next. In the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at a previous address, it shall retain the Household number and Split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave."
RB050,PERSONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL WEIGHT,"0+ (format 2.5) Weight (see the required format) 1 -7 Filled Not applicable (RB010 not equal to “last year of operation""). See construction of weights in chapter ‘Weights’ These weights had to be coded with two integers and five decimals."
RB060,PERSONAL BASE WEIGHT,"In practice, personal cross-sectional weights will be coded with at least one integer and five decimals. The personal base weight can have the value 0, namely for non-panel persons."
RB062,LONGITUDINAL WEIGHT [TWO-YEAR DURATION],"0+ (format 2.5) Weight (see the required format) 1 -1 -2 Filled Missing Not applicable (only one year trajectory for the individual, i.e., individual in first wave). Longitudinal weights are constructed after all other set of weights are defined for the y-1."

Countries having 4 years panel will use flag not applicable."
RB080,YEAR OF BIRTH,"When asking for the passing of birthday at the time of the interview, the following questions are recommended: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" At data collection level, the exact date of birth might be asked directly to the respondents. This variable is supposed to be collected during the first interview (the first wave), however needs to be transmitted to Eurostat annually."
RB081,AGE IN COMPLETED YEARS (AT THE END OF,"The quality reporting related to the variable 'age in completed years' should contain information on the number of records for which information on the age in completed years is imputed and this imputed value should be reported in the flags. When asking whether the birthday has passed at the time of the interview, it is recommended to use the following question: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" Age."
RB082,AGE IN COMPLETED YEARS AT THE TIME OF THE,"When asking whether the birthday has passed at the time of the interview, the following questions are recommended: ""What is your year of birth? Have you already had your birthday this year?"" In case the reference date is not the time of the interview, the question has to be adapted, clearly explaining which reference date the passing of birthday should refer to. The quality reporting related to the variable 'age in completed years' should contain information on the number of records for which information on the age in completed years is imputed and this imputed value should be reported in the flags."
RB083,PASSING OF BIRTHDAY AT THE TIME OF THE,"Use of the following questions are recommended: ""Have you already had your birthday this year?"" At data collection level, the exact date of birth might be asked directly to the respondents. In this case the recommended question is: ""What is your date of birth?"" (DD/MM/YYYY)."
