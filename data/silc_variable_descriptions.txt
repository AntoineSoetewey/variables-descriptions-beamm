Variable	Short_description	Long_description
DB010	 Year of the survey	"It represents the year in which the survey-data collection, or most of the collection, is carried out."
DB020	 Country of residence 	The variable identifies the country in which the usual residence of the person/household is located.
DB030	 Household ID 	"Every household receives a household number which serves as the base to construct the Household ID and Personal ID. This number must be unique for all years of the survey. The Household ID is a unique identification number for each household. Country code, year, and IDs are used as key variables to merge different files."
DB040	 Region of residence 	"The variable indicates the region within the country of residence in which the usual residence of the household is located at the date of interview. From 2021 onwards, it classifies regions into three types of area based on population density: 'Cities', 'Towns and suburbs', and 'Rural areas'. This classification uses geographical contiguity and minimum population threshold applied to 1 km2 grid cells, largely based on the NUTS classification."
DB050	 Stratum 	This variable reports on the primary stratum corresponding to each observation unit (individual or household) in cases where the target population is stratified at the first stage of sample design. It provides identification codes for the different strata. The information collected is sampling information needed to calculate measures of spread (like variance and standard deviation) and to observe changes over time. It specifically collects information about the primary strata used in selecting the sample.
DB060	 Primary sampling units [PSU] 	"This variable measures the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) used in selecting the sample. It reports on the PSU corresponding to each observation unit (individual or household) when the target population is divided into clusters. It provides identification codes for these clusters or PSUs. The information collected is sampling data needed to calculate measures of spread (e.g., variance and standard deviation) and to observe changes over time. Multi-stage sampling involves dividing the population into PSUs at the first stage, which is done when direct-element sampling is impossible or too expensive."
DB062	 Secondary sampling units [SSU] 	"The variable DB062 provides identification codes for selected Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs) when a multi-stage sampling design is used.
